For this reason, we adhere to the following basic principles to protect customer data:\n\n*   We **never** share our customers' personal or business data with third parties\n*   Revenue Grid **never** stores any of your Salesforce or MS Exchange/Office 365/Gmail data, such as contacts, emails, calendar items, etc. The relevant data is only discreetly transferred through the cloud app, temporarily cached in [secure MS Azure servers'](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security/fundamentals/overview) memory and is **never** written to any persistent storage nor transferred outside of the established secured infrastructure. Essential exceptions to this principle:\n    *   What data is temporarily cached for logging purposes by Revenue Inbox: 1\\. [identifiers](https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=000004383&language=en_US&r=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F&type=1) and *last modified* dates of the records processed by [Revenue Inbox sync](https://smartcloudconnect.io/docs/fast-channel/articles/SmartCloud-Connect-Synchronization-An-Overview/); 2\\. the names of records with which the Sync engine had issues, solely to indicate them to the end users and Admins in [sync error notifications](https://smartcloudconnect.io/docs/fast-channel/articles/Handling-Sync-Issues/); 3\\. [Revenue Inbox Meetings Scheduler](https://smartcloudconnect.io/docs/fast-channel/articles/How-to-Send-Meeting-Time-Slots-(Adaptive-view)/) temporarily keeps specified slots and spans to build selection tables for the recipients.\n    *   Unlike Revenue Inbox, Revenue Grid has to store specific customer and communication data which is required for performing its sales engagement and communication automation functions: the users' email correspondence history and contacts imported from Salesforce are securely and discretely kept on Revenue Grid's MS Azure servers.\n    *   No automatic Revenue Inbox customers opt-ins into Revenue Grid are performed; the customers must agree to the additional Revenue Grid Privacy Policy clauses before switching.  \n    \n*   Any personally identifiable information which gets transferred through our servers is secured with industry standard protocols and encryption technologies; more on this below.\n\nSee also: [RevenueGrid.com Privacy Policy](https://revenuegrid.com/privacy-policy/).\n\n&nbsp;\n\n### Official certification and regular audit\n\n\u21db  [SOC2 Type II certified](https://www.aicpa.org/content/dam/aicpa/interestareas/frc/assuranceadvisoryservices/downloadabledocuments/trust-services-criteria.pdf): Security, Availability, Processing Integrity, Confidentiality, and Privacy Audit  \n\n\u21db [Privacy shield](https://www.privacyshield.gov/Program-Overview) certified  \n\n- [EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework](https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt0000000CjKUAA0&status=Active)  \n\n- [Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework](https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt0000000CjKUAA0&status=Active)  \n\n\u21db [GDPR](https://gdpr.eu/tag/gdpr/) compliant   \n\n\u21db [HIPAA Seal of Compliance](https://compliancy-group.com/hipaa-compliance-verification/) verified\n\n\u21db [ISO-27001](https://www.iso.org/isoiec-27001-information-security.html) (Information Security Management set) certified  \n\n\u21db [A multisided solution security review carried out by NCC Group](https://cyberstore.nccgroup.com/our-services/service-details/8/cyber-security-review)  \n\n\u21db Revenue Grid is a longstanding [certified Microsoft Partner](https://partner.microsoft.com/en-us/membership/windows-and-devices-competency) based on [special competency requirements](https://partner.microsoft.com/en-us/membership/competencies)  \n\n\u21db All Revenue Grid components undergo regular [penetration tests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penetration_test) carried out by independent contractors  \n\n\u21db Revenue Grid technical support team ensures super-fast reaction to security cases as well other kinds of reports. See [this article](https://revenuegrid.com/news/g2-best-support-badge/) for more information\n\n&nbsp;\n\n### Confidentiality and Availability  \n\nWe implemented appropriate technical, organizational, and administrative systems, policies, and procedures designed to ensure the security, integrity, and confidentiality of customer data and to mitigate the risk of unauthorized access to or use of customer content.\n\nUnless other terms apply or agreed otherwise, with respect to subscription based SaaS Services, during the prepaid subscription Revenue Grid will use commercially reasonable efforts to make the SaaS Services available 24 hours per day, 7 (seven) days per week, except for planned maintenance and emergency downtime and any unavailability due to circumstances out of Revenue Grid's control (including but not limited to customer's misuse of the Services; failures of customer's or its users' internet connectivity; Internet or other network traffic problems etc.).\n\n&nbsp;\n\n### Security Policies\n\nWith over 13 years of experience of building and implementing successful enterprise solutions, we know very well that email correspondence and CRM data stand among the key assets of any modern business. For this reason handling all communications between your email and CRM systems and Revenue Grid with maximum security is our topmost priority.\n\nWe follow a multi-level layered approach, which is continuously updated with the latest technologies to ensure the highest level of security for our customers' data, from complete physical security of Microsoft certified data centers we use to secured access authorization procedures for the end users (see below) and the [latest encrypted data transfer protocols](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office365/troubleshoot/security/prepare-tls-1.2-in-office-365).  \n\n&nbsp;\n\n#### Application Design\n\n[Revenue Inbox Sync component](https://smartcloudconnect.io/docs/fast-channel/articles/AddIn-vs-Sync-Functions/), also used in Revenue Grid's architecture, is built as a scalable customized [Microsoft Azure service](https://searchcloudcomputing.techtarget.com/definition/Windows-Azure) which supports geo-distributed data centers and provides the highest levels of availability and resilience; it matches Microsoft's standards for secure applications.\n\n[The Sidebar widget component of Revenue Grid](../Sidebar/) is a web rendition of an [MS Outlook add-in](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook/add-ins/) verified by Microsoft that works directly with users' email and CRM data, also displaying relevant information for the end users and conveying their inputs, actions, and choices to Revenue Grid, email server or Salesforce.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n#### Service Authentication\n\nAll RG end users follow the most secure access authentication procedures:\n\n* [Single Sign-On](https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=sso_about.htm&type=5) to access Salesforce and [OAuth 2.0](https://oauth.net/2/) for Office 365\n\n* Using [OAuth 2.0](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-oauth2-auth-code-flow) to grant MS Exchange data access, with optional fallback to login/password authentication for legacy MS Exchange servers\n\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n#### Granular Access Control\n\nOur app's access to user configurations and data is built on granular level, it is based on the concepts of Permissions, Roles, Principals, Resources and Authorizations:\n\n*   All data views, transfers, or other related actions are controlled by structured permission rules\n*   Combination of Permission sets into Roles allows to define allowed operations scopes very specifically\n*   In RG data access architecture, assigning of Principals, Roles for specific Resources access, results in granting of the minimum required permissions level for performing of very specific tasks\n\nThis access control policy covers **all** Revenue Grid users, including Invisible.io Admins: Sales, Support and Customer Success teams, to ensure that the customers' data is accessible **only** by the entitled end users.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n#### Data Protection\n\nRevenue Grid ensures multi-level protection of sensitive data from accidental or malicious loss, whether in transit, at rest, or on the go. Among standard techniques, that includes:\n\n*   **Access to Salesforce, Office 365, and Gmail data** is performed through certified apps on respective services  \n*   **In-transit encryption**: all data transfers between Salesforce/Microsoft Exchange or Google servers as well as user interactions with them via RG are encrypted with [TLS protocol](https://www.internetsociety.org/deploy360/tls/basics/)  \n*   **At rest encryption**: all relevant configuration data is encrypted in rest state on [physical storage database level](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-service-encryption)  \n*   **Secrets handling**: all used access secrets (tokens, passwords) are additionally encrypted on application level using keys transferred separately from the data. Furthermore, RG [API connections](https://www.upwork.com/hiring/development/intro-to-apis-what-is-an-api/) are designed in such a way so access secrets never leave Revenue Grid perimeter  \n*   **Data backup and point-in-time restore**: users' and orgs' configuration data is continuously backed-up automatically; it is kept as multiple copies, ensuring the possibility to do a point-in-time restore\n*   **Data isolation**: [server-side synchronization of data](https://smartcloudconnect.io/docs/fast-channel/articles/SmartCloud-Connect-Synchronization-An-Overview/) of different RG users is logically and physically isolated, which guarantees that no data can be transferred or leak between the users, in any other ways but ones defined by Salesforce or Microsoft Exchange / Office 365 / Gmail\n\n&nbsp;\n\n#### Infrastructure\n\n*   **Data centers**: Revenue Grid is hosted on [Microsoft Azure data centers](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/global-infrastructure/) which ensure the [highest security levels](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security/fundamentals/overview)\n*   **Security Updates**: Revenue Grid is a managed cloud solution; that, regular besides updates of RG features, implies automatic front-end and back-end data security infrastructure updates  \n*   **Firewalls and network access**: Revenue Grid uses Microsoft Azure's capabilities to run its services in a secure virtual network with limited and strictly audited external access\n*   **Networking**: no server used by Revenue Grid for user data transfers or config keeping is accessible from outside the network. Any externally visible services operate behind a firewall and a load balancer within this virtual private network\n\n### Contact Us\n\nIf you have questions or concerns about how your information is handled, please direct your inquiry to\u202fAvora\u202fHoldings LTD at: \n\n**Avora\u202fHoldings LTD.** **950 East Paces Ferry Road, N.E., Suite 2150 Salesforce Tower, Atlanta, GA 30326** \n\nCompany Communications; 13110 NE 177th Place, Suite 135 Woodinville, WA 98072. \n\n[**E-Mail:**\u202f**privacy@**revenuegrid.com](mailto:E-Mail:\u202fprivacy@revenuegrid.com) \n\n **Phone number:** +1 866 684 9276 \n \n \n\n\n\n\n",

For this reason, we adhere to the following basic principles to protect customer data:\nWe never share our customers' personal or business data with third parties\nRevenue Grid never stores any of your Salesforce or MS Exchange/Office 365/Gmail data, such as contacts, emails, calendar items, etc. The relevant data is only discreetly transferred through the cloud app, temporarily cached in secure MS Azure servers' memory and is never written to any persistent storage nor transferred outside of the established secured infrastructure. Essential exceptions to this principle:\nWhat data is temporarily cached for logging purposes by Revenue Inbox: 1. identifiers and last modified dates of the records processed by Revenue Inbox sync; 2. the names of records with which the Sync engine had issues, solely to indicate them to the end users and Admins in sync error notifications; 3. Revenue Inbox Meetings Scheduler temporarily keeps specified slots and spans to build selection tables for the recipients.\nUnlike Revenue Inbox, Revenue Grid has to store specific customer and communication data which is required for performing its sales engagement and communication automation functions: the users' email correspondence history and contacts imported from Salesforce are securely and discretely kept on Revenue Grid's MS Azure servers.\nNo automatic Revenue Inbox customers opt-ins into Revenue Grid are performed; the customers must agree to the additional Revenue Grid Privacy Policy clauses before switching. \nAny personally identifiable information which gets transferred through our servers is secured with industry standard protocols and encryption technologies; more on this below.\nSee also: RevenueGrid.com Privacy Policy.\nOfficial certification and regular audit\n\u21db SOC2 Type II certified: Security, Availability, Processing Integrity, Confidentiality, and Privacy Audit \n\u21db Privacy shield certified \nEU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework \nSwiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework \n\u21db GDPR compliant \n\u21db HIPAA Seal of Compliance verified\n\u21db ISO-27001 (Information Security Management set) certified \n\u21db A multisided solution security review carried out by NCC Group \n\u21db Revenue Grid is a longstanding certified Microsoft Partner based on special competency requirements \n\u21db All Revenue Grid components undergo regular penetration tests carried out by independent contractors \n\u21db Revenue Grid technical support team ensures super-fast reaction to security cases as well other kinds of reports. See this article for more information\nConfidentiality and Availability\nWe implemented appropriate technical, organizational, and administrative systems, policies, and procedures designed to ensure the security, integrity, and confidentiality of customer data and to mitigate the risk of unauthorized access to or use of customer content.\nUnless other terms apply or agreed otherwise, with respect to subscription based SaaS Services, during the prepaid subscription Revenue Grid will use commercially reasonable efforts to make the SaaS Services available 24 hours per day, 7 (seven) days per week, except for planned maintenance and emergency downtime and any unavailability due to circumstances out of Revenue Grid's control (including but not limited to customer's misuse of the Services; failures of customer's or its users' internet connectivity; Internet or other network traffic problems etc.).\nSecurity Policies\nWith over 13 years of experience of building and implementing successful enterprise solutions, we know very well that email correspondence and CRM data stand among the key assets of any modern business. For this reason handling all communications between your email and CRM systems and Revenue Grid with maximum security is our topmost priority.\nWe follow a multi-level layered approach, which is continuously updated with the latest technologies to ensure the highest level of security for our customers' data, from complete physical security of Microsoft certified data centers we use to secured access authorization procedures for the end users (see below) and the latest encrypted data transfer protocols. \nApplication Design\nRevenue Inbox Sync component, also used in Revenue Grid's architecture, is built as a scalable customized Microsoft Azure service which supports geo-distributed data centers and provides the highest levels of availability and resilience; it matches Microsoft's standards for secure applications.\nThe Sidebar widget component of Revenue Grid is a web rendition of an MS Outlook add-in verified by Microsoft that works directly with users' email and CRM data, also displaying relevant information for the end users and conveying their inputs, actions, and choices to Revenue Grid, email server or Salesforce.\nService Authentication\nAll RG end users follow the most secure access authentication procedures:\nSingle Sign-On to access Salesforce and OAuth 2.0 for Office 365\nUsing OAuth 2.0 to grant MS Exchange data access, with optional fallback to login/password authentication for legacy MS Exchange servers\nGranular Access Control\nOur app's access to user configurations and data is built on granular level, it is based on the concepts of Permissions, Roles, Principals, Resources and Authorizations:\nAll data views, transfers, or other related actions are controlled by structured permission rules\nCombination of Permission sets into Roles allows to define allowed operations scopes very specifically\nIn RG data access architecture, assigning of Principals, Roles for specific Resources access, results in granting of the minimum required permissions level for performing of very specific tasks\nThis access control policy covers all Revenue Grid users, including Invisible.io Admins: Sales, Support and Customer Success teams, to ensure that the customers' data is accessible only by the entitled end users.\nData Protection\nRevenue Grid ensures multi-level protection of sensitive data from accidental or malicious loss, whether in transit, at rest, or on the go. Among standard techniques, that includes:\nAccess to Salesforce, Office 365, and Gmail data is performed through certified apps on respective services \nIn-transit encryption: all data transfers between Salesforce/Microsoft Exchange or Google servers as well as user interactions with them via RG are encrypted with TLS protocol \nAt rest encryption: all relevant configuration data is encrypted in rest state on physical storage database level \nSecrets handling: all used access secrets (tokens, passwords) are additionally encrypted on application level using keys transferred separately from the data. Furthermore, RG API connections are designed in such a way so access secrets never leave Revenue Grid perimeter \nData backup and point-in-time restore: users' and orgs' configuration data is continuously backed-up automatically; it is kept as multiple copies, ensuring the possibility to do a point-in-time restore\nData isolation: server-side synchronization of data of different RG users is logically and physically isolated, which guarantees that no data can be transferred or leak between the users, in any other ways but ones defined by Salesforce or Microsoft Exchange / Office 365 / Gmail\nInfrastructure\nData centers: Revenue Grid is hosted on Microsoft Azure data centers which ensure the highest security levels\nSecurity Updates: Revenue Grid is a managed cloud solution; that, regular besides updates of RG features, implies automatic front-end and back-end data security infrastructure updates \nFirewalls and network access: Revenue Grid uses Microsoft Azure's capabilities to run its services in a secure virtual network with limited and strictly audited external access\nNetworking: no server used by Revenue Grid for user data transfers or config keeping is accessible from outside the network. Any externally visible services operate behind a firewall and a load balancer within this virtual private network\nContact Us\nIf you have questions or concerns about how your information is handled, please direct your inquiry to\u202fAvora\u202fHoldings LTD at: \nAvora\u202fHoldings LTD. 950 East Paces Ferry Road, N.E., Suite 2150 Salesforce Tower, Atlanta, GA 30326 \nCompany Communications; 13110 NE 177th Place, Suite 135 Woodinville, WA 98072. \nE-Mail:\u202fprivacy@revenuegrid.com \nPhone number: +1 866 684 9276"
