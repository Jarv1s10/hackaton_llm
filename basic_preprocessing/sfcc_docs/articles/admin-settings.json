Enforced limits to the number of [RE Sequence emails](../Create-new-sequence/#email_type_of_a_step) sent by RG users.\n\n<b>Number of sequence email/sms touches an RG user can send per day</b>\n\n<p>To prevent SPAM generation, most email services impose a limitation on the number of emails a user (or automated emailing software) can send through a single email account per specific period of time. The applied limit is 1 email sent per 1 minute.\n<br><br>\nWhen Revenue Grid sends out emails, both custom written by a user and automated ones, it respects this limitation, observing the one minute minimum interval between sending emails.\n<br><br>\nThe recommended (default) value of this setting is 500 emails; this value approximates the maximum number of emails that can be sent over a standard working day's span with a one minute interval. It is the emails quantity \"bandwidth\" shared by all email sequences you run in RG.  <br><br>\nWhen the limit is reached, all remaining automated emails have to be postponed to the following day's sending span defined by the Sequence's Schedule, regardless of the step's actual timeline. Therefore, please consider this standard limit of 500 emails/day per RG user when planning your emailing campaigns.\n<br><br>\nThe maximum value that can be set for this parameter is 1000, that is approximately 17 hours of automated emailing per 24 hours. If you do <b>not</b> set a limited daily Schedule for the Sequence (for example to imitate emails sending by a real person)  that is emails sending will be allowed for 24 hours, this increased limit is easily attainable, since the automated emails are sent out by your email server.</p>\n<br>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"admonition tip\">\n<p class=\"admonition-title\">Important</p>\n<p>In a realistic common case scenario a single RG user can send out around 100 emails per working day; this number is defined by his/her capability to process the recipient's responses to these emails. However, a informative mass email campaign that requires no specific response can make use from the maximum emailing \"bandwidth\".   \n<br>\n\tPlease note that there is also another factor that defines individual emails dispatching patterns, the *Schedule idle* parameter <a href=\"../Create-new-sequence/#adding_and_editing_steps_toof_a_sequence\">set for Sequence steps</a></p>\n</div>\n\n<b>Number of sequence call, misc and signal steps scheduled per day</b>\n\nSet the limit to number of automatic or manual steps of these types that can be scheduled per user per day.\n\n<br>\n<b>Sequence touches limit per email domain per day</b>\n\nSet the limit of touches per specific domain to avoid overwhelming a certain company with your outreaches.\n\n<br>\n<b>Sequence touches limit per prospect per day</b>\n\n\u200b\tThe number of RG sequence emails allowed to be sent to a prospect per 24 hours. This parameter is set depending on the essence of the campaign and the target auditory. Normally the maximum number of such emails should not exceed 5, not to get a prospect annoyed. Note that this number does not include extra \"custom\" emails message composed by a RG user, for example a reaction to a prospect's reply or a follow-up clarifying a previously sent email. This parameter's default value is 5 and the maximum value is 10.\n\n\n<br>\n<b>Sequence touches limit per prospect per week</b>\n\nThis parameter is similar to the above one, only it sets the RG sequence emails limit imposed over a period of one week. This parameter's default value is 10 and the maximum value is 20.\n\n\n<br>\n\n<b>Active sequences per prospect</b>\n\nHow many active sequences a user can have at the same time.\n<br>\n\n\n<!--\n### Teamwork\n\nGo to Setting \u2192 <b>Teamwork</b> subtab. \n<a href=\"../Access-rights/\"><b>Read an extended article describing Admin rights vs regular user rights</b></a>\n\n<p> <img src=\"../../assets/images/Settings/ownership.png\" style=\"width: 70%; height: 70%;\" class=\"center\"></p>\n\n\n<h4> Allow access to prospects, owned by the other users</h4>\n\n\n<p style=\"margin-left:2%;\"> When the checkbox is selected: </p>\n<p style=\"margin-left:5%;\"> \n\u2022\tAll regular users have access to leads and contacts owned by other SFDC users for prospect search/import, given that these prospects are visible to them in SFDC <br>\n\u2022\tAll regular users can add all leads and contacts directly to Revenue Grid <a href=\"../People\">Audience</a> page or to Sequences<br>\n\u2022\tAll regular users have access to all all leads and contacts on Audience page, organization wide<br>\n\u2022\tAll regular users can delete their own Prospects only<br>\n\u2022\tAll regular users have access to the <a href=\"../People/#contactlead_profile\">Activity History</a> of all the prospects in Revenue Grid, organization wide<br>\n\u2022\tdrop-down \"Emails are being sent on behalf of\" becomes enabled (see below)<br>\n</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left:2%;\"> When the checkbox is cleared: </p>\n<p style=\"margin-left:5%;\"> \n\u2022\tAll regular users can't access leads and contacts they don't own.

It is the emails quantity \"bandwidth\" shared by all email sequences you run in RG. \nWhen the limit is reached, all remaining automated emails have to be postponed to the following day's sending span defined by the Sequence's Schedule, regardless of the step's actual timeline. Therefore, please consider this standard limit of 500 emails/day per RG user when planning your emailing campaigns.\n \nThe maximum value that can be set for this parameter is 1000, that is approximately 17 hours of automated emailing per 24 hours. If you do not set a limited daily Schedule for the Sequence (for example to imitate emails sending by a real person) that is emails sending will be allowed for 24 hours, this increased limit is easily attainable, since the automated emails are sent out by your email server. \n \n \n Important \n In a realistic common case scenario a single RG user can send out around 100 emails per working day; this number is defined by his/her capability to process the recipient's responses to these emails. However, a informative mass email campaign that requires no specific response can make use from the maximum emailing \"bandwidth\". \n \n Please note that there is also another factor that defines individual emails dispatching patterns, the *Schedule idle* parameter set for Sequence steps \n \n Number of sequence call, misc and signal steps scheduled per day \nSet the limit to number of automatic or manual steps of these types that can be scheduled per user per day.\n \n Sequence touches limit per email domain per day \nSet the limit of touches per specific domain to avoid overwhelming a certain company with your outreaches.\n \n Sequence touches limit per prospect per day \n\u200b The number of RG sequence emails allowed to be sent to a prospect per 24 hours. This parameter is set depending on the essence of the campaign and the target auditory. Normally the maximum number of such emails should not exceed 5, not to get a prospect annoyed. Note that this number does not include extra \"custom\" emails message composed by a RG user, for example a reaction to a prospect's reply or a follow-up clarifying a previously sent email. This parameter's default value is 5 and the maximum value is 10.\n \n Sequence touches limit per prospect per week \nThis parameter is similar to the above one, only it sets the RG sequence emails limit imposed over a period of one week. This parameter's default value is 10 and the maximum value is 20.\n \n Active sequences per prospect \nHow many active sequences a user can have at the same time.\n \n<!--\n### Teamwork\nGo to Setting \u2192 Teamwork subtab. \n Read an extended article describing Admin rights vs regular user rights \n \n Allow access to prospects, owned by the other users \n When the checkbox is selected: \n \n\u2022 All regular users have access to leads and contacts owned by other SFDC users for prospect search/import, given that these prospects are visible to them in SFDC \n\u2022 All regular users can add all leads and contacts directly to Revenue Grid Audience page or to Sequences \n\u2022 All regular users have access to all all leads and contacts on Audience page, organization wide \n\u2022 All regular users can delete their own Prospects only \n\u2022 All regular users have access to the Activity History of all the prospects in Revenue Grid, organization wide \n\u2022 drop-down \"Emails are being sent on behalf of\" becomes enabled (see below) \n \n When the checkbox is cleared: \n \n\u2022 All regular users can't access leads and contacts they don't own. Not while searching/importing in/from SFDC, not on Revenue Grid Audience page, nor able to add other users' prospects to sequences. \n\u2022 All regular users have access to the Activity History of only those prospects who have been involved in their sequences at least once\n \n \n Note \n Regardless of this setting, Admin level users always have full access to all prospects available on Revenue Grid Audience page, can delete any prospect, as well as see all the items for every prospect in Activity History . \n \n Email is being sent in every sequence on behalf of \n \nIn this drop-down, choose default value which will be populated in corresponding field while creating a new sequence.\n \nPossible values to choose from are: \n \n\u2022 Prospect's owner - recipients will receive emails generated by the sequence from whoever is listed as their owners in Salesforce, no matter who runs the sequence \n\u2022 Sequence owner - recipients will receive emails generated by the sequence from whoever runs the sequence \n \n-->\n \n \nCustomize status mapping to Salesforce\nGo to Setting \u2192 Sequences under Platform Settings \u2192 Status mapping subtab. On this tab, Admins can map Prospect statuses to any value of any field in Salesforce for seamless mirroring, as well as create additional Prospect statuses tailored for any possible business need. Updates on this tab will get applied to all users in an Organization. \nBy default, you get these Person statuses mapped to following values of the selected Salesforce fields (see the picture below).\n \n \n \nManage sending schedules\n \nGo to Settings \u2192 Sequences under Platform Settings \u2192 Schedules subtab. On this tab you can create and manage email send-out schedules which you use in RE Sequence.\n \n \nA schedule is a set of specific days of the week and daily time intervals (set in the prospect's Time zone retrieved from Salesforce) used in RG Sequences. Automated emails sent by Revenue Grid will only be dispatched on these days and within these time intervals.\n \nIf you wish to exclude automated emails sending on the dates which are public holidays in the USA, you need to select the checkbox Exclude federal US Holidays in the schedule creation/editing dialog.\n \n \nThe schedules you select for your sequence steps are overridden by wait intervals set for individual steps.\nFor example, if you create a sequence consisting of steps scheduled for every other day of the week except weekends (that is 3 sequence emails per business week) and set the wait interval between the steps to two days, the steps will be performed with a two day long interval (that is 2 sequence emails per business week). At the same, if the schedule implies sending one email per week, a two day long wait interval between steps will be always observed, not affecting the sending schedule. \n \nManage signals\n \nGo to Settings \u2192 Signals subtab. This setting is available to Managers only. Here you can select which signals to run company-wide. Once a signal is disabled, already generated signals of that type will not disappear from the interface until resolved.\n \n \n \nManage all users\n \nGo to Settings \u2192 Users subtab. On this tab, Admins can see company-wide Revenue Grid users, their:\n \n\u2022 Names \n\u2022 Emails \n\u2022 Who are their delegates (if any) \n\u2022 What is their Dial-out and Texting phone numbers (if any) to perform SMS and Phone call types of steps \n\u2022 and Role (Admin or a regular User)\n \n \n \nBy clicking on a user, Admins can see their Account tab , where they can set up delegates, select SMS and Voice numbers, grant admin rights, and set up Primary signature.\n \n "
