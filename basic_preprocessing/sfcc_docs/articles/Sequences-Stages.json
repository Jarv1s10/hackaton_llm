It means that negotiation with the prospect is taking place outside of Revenue Grid. A prospect gets to this stage when a RG user marks his/her [Person Status](../Prospect-Statuses/#types_of_person_statuses) so by choosing \"Finished: Success\" manually through [Action Center's Replies tab](../Replies/), or on the [Sequences' *Recipients* tab](../Recipients/#mass_actions) or via [Sequence widget](../Sidebar/). \n\n**Not interested** - a prospect gets to this stage when a RG user marks his/her [Person Status](../Prospect-Statuses/#types_of_person_statuses) so by choosing \"Finished: Not interested\" manually through [Action Center's Replies tab](../Replies/), or on the [Sequences' Recipients tab](../Recipients/#mass_actions) or via [Sequence widget](../Sidebar/). \n\n**Opted out** - when a prospect is on this stage, it means either he/she has unsubscribed through [the unsubscribe link](../Settings/#unsubscribe_links) or RG user marked his/her [Person Status](../Prospect-Statuses/#types_of_person_statuses) so on [Action Center's Replies tab](../Replies/), or on the [Sequences' Recipients tab](../Recipients/#mass_actions), or on the [profile page](../People/#contactlead_profile), or via [Sequence widget](../Sidebar/).\n\n**Bounced** - this stage is auto-assigns when *Undelivered Mail Returned to sender* type of an email is received in response to your email type of a step. Or else you can assign a prospect to Bounced [Person Status](../Prospect-Statuses/#types_of_person_statuses) via [Sequence widget](../Sidebar/) and in its turn this stage will be assigned automatically.\n\n**Unresponsive **- this stage is auto-assigned when there has been no response from a prospect to an email type of a step for 1 week.\n\n\n\n------\n\n\n\n### Corresponding Person Status\n\nThis table represents corresponding [Person Status](../Prospect-Statuses/#types_of_person_statuses) per each Sequence Stage available in Revenue Grid.\n\n\n\n<table>\n    <thead>\n        <tr>\n            <th rowspan=3 colspan=3 align=\"center\"><b>Revenue Grid</b></th>\n        </tr>\n    </thead>\n    <tbody>\n        <tr>\n            <td align=\"center\"><b>Sequence Stage</b></td>\n            <td align=\"center\"><b>\u21c4</b></td>\n            <td align=\"center\"><b>Person Status</b></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td align=\"center\">Not started</td>\n            <td align=\"center\">\u2194</td>\n            <td align=\"center\">Not contacted</td>\n        </tr>\n            <td align=\"center\">Started</td>\n        \t<td align=\"center\">\u2194</td>\n            <td align=\"center\">Just added</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td align=\"center\">Bounced</td>\n            <td align=\"center\">\u2194</td>\n            <td align=\"center\">Bounced</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td align=\"center\">Approaching</td>\n            <td align=\"center\">\u2194</td>\n            <td align=\"center\">In progress</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td align=\"center\">Opted out</td>\n            <td align=\"center\">\u2194</td>\n            <td align=\"center\">Unsubscribed</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td align=\"center\">Not interested</td>\n            <td align=\"center\">\u2194</td>\n            <td align=\"center\">Not interested</td>\n        </tr>\n         <tr>\n            <td align=\"center\">Success</td>\n            <td align=\"center\">\u2194</td>\n            <td align=\"center\">Success</td>\n        </tr>\n         <tr>\n            <td align=\"center\">Unresponsive</td>\n            <td align=\"center\">\u2194</td>\n            <td align=\"center\">Unresponsive</td>\n        </tr>\n    </tbody>\n</table>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
