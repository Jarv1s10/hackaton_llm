The life-cycle of statuses start from <i>Just Added</i>, once a prospect gets imported into Revenue Grid.\n</p>\nProspect status updates can be:\n\n- automatic, triggered by a [Sequence stage change](../Sequences-Stages/)\n- initiated by users on Revenue Grid side on [Action Center](../Planner/), [Audience](../People/), [Sequences' Recipients tab](../Recipients/) or via [Sequence widget](../Sidebar/)\n- or initiated by users on Salesforce side and get reflected on Revenue Grid side automatically according to [custom mapping](../Prospect-Statuses/#custom_salesforce_mapping)\n\n\n\n!!! tip \"Tip\"\n    If you do **not** want prospect's Revenue Grid status to get updated automatically when a Sequence [proceeds to its next stage](../Sequences-Stages/), clear the \"*Update Person status on Sequence Stage Change*\" checkbox in the [Sequence's settings](../Settings-of-Sequences). That is useful, for example, if running a secondary nurturing [email Sequence](../Create-new-sequence/).\n\n------\n\n## Default types of Person statuses\n\n\n**Just added**  - prospect has been added to [Audience page](../People/) but it's not involved in any Sequences yet.\n\n**Not contacted**  - this status indicates that a prospect has been added to a sequence, but no outreach has been made yet.\n\n**Approaching** - prospect engagement is in progress, going through the [steps](../Create-new-sequence/#adding_and_editing_steps_toof_a_sequence) according to the sequence schedule.\n\n**On hold** - this status is assigned manually by a RG user. Such prospect will not proceed to a following step within any Sequences enrolled.\n\n\n**Success** - this status is assigned manually by a RG user by clicking \"Finish: Success\" on [Action Center's Replies tab](../Replies/), on the [Sequences' Recipients tab](../Recipients/#mass_actions) or via [Sequence widget](../Sidebar/). This status means that the engagement was successful, thus sequence will not reach out to this prospect anymore and further negotiations will take place outside of Revenue Grid.\n\n**Not interested**  - this status is assigned manually by a RG user by clicking \"Finish: Not interested\" on [Action Center's Replies tab](../Replies/), on the [Sequences' *Recipients* tab](../Recipients/#mass_actions) or via [Sequence widget](../Sidebar/) when a prospect expresses his/her disinterest in this campaign. However, this prospect can still be contacted in a course of other campaigns.\n\n**Opted Out** - this status can be assigned both, manually or automatically. Manually by a RG user by clicking \"Finish: Opt Out\" on [Action Center's Replies tab](../Replies/), on the [Sequences' Recipients tab](../Recipients/#mass_actions), on the [profile page](../People/#contactlead_profile), or via [Sequence widget](../Sidebar/). Also it may happen automatically if a prospect clicks [the unsubscribe link](../Settings/#unsubscribe_links) in a received email.\n\n**Bounced** - this status is also can be assigned both, manually or automatically. Manually via [RG Sequence widget](../Sidebar/). Automatically, if a [hard bounce](https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/hard-bounce) delivery failure notification was received in response to a [Sequence email](../Create-new-sequence/#email_type_of_a_step), then Revenue Grid will change this prospect's status to Bounced; in addition, the delivery failure automatic email will be put to the [Notifications](../Notifications/) tab in the Action Center. \n\n!!! tip \"Note\"\n    If a prospect has **Bounced** status, then it's not going to be possible to *Opt out* the prospect anywhere throughout Revenue Grid. Whether on [Audience](../People/#mass_action), [Prospect's Profile page](../People/#contactlead_profile), [Recipients](../Recipients/#mass_actions) tabs nor via the [Sidebar](../Sidebar).\n\n**Unresponsive** - this prospect status is automatically assigned if there has been no response from a prospect to [automated email sequence messages](../Create-new-sequence/#email_type_of_a_step) for 1 week. In this case either another communication channel should be used or another lead from the same company should be engaged. If a prospect responds some time later, the status can be updated to *Success*, *Not interested*, or *Opted out*.\n\n\n<br>\n<br>\n<hr>\n\n## Custom Salesforce mapping to boolean or pick-list types of a field\n\nWhen a contact\u2019s or a lead\u2019s status changes in Revenue Grid, it may get reflected in Salesforce according to custom mapping. It also may work other way around; if a status changes directly in Salesforce, then it gets reflected in Revenue Grid. Custom mapping of Revenue Grid statuses to Salesforce depends on each company\u2019s needs and business flow. \n\n<div class=\"admonition hint\">\n<p class=\"admonition-title\">Here is an example how it works</p>\n<p style=\"font-size:16px\"> Let's say you mapped an additional field (Rating) and its value (Warm), to the \"Approaching\" status.\n<img src=\"../../assets/images/Settings/map-status.png\" style=\"width: 90%; height: 90%;\"/>\nExplained:<br>\nWhen a lead's Person status changes to Approaching in Revenue Grid, along with Salesforce field (Status) changing to \"Attempting to Contact\", also another Salesforce field (Rating) will get populated with corresponding value (Warm).\n<br><br>\nAnd since the \"Bidirectional\" checkbox is selected, similarly the mirroring will happen other way around as well.
