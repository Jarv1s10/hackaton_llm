What happens when you edit a Template?\n\n<!--\n<br>\n<img src=\"../../assets/images/faq/seq-widget-full.png\" style=\"width: 70%; height: 70%;\"/>\n<p style=\"margin-left:5%;\"> \n<br>-->\n\nBe cautious when you edit a <a href=\"../Templates/\">template</a>. Before editing a template, be aware of sequences which have steps built using the template.\n<br><br>\nWhen a template gets edited, all steps which the template had been used for will be updated seamlessly. Whether the template-based step is <a href=\"../Overview/#automatic_vs_manual_type_of_a_step\">automatic</a>, then the updated outreach will be carried out in its timely manner; or the template-based step is <a href=\"../Overview/#automatic_vs_manual_type_of_a_step\">manual</a>, then the updated draft will be waiting for you in the Action Center.<br> \n\n<div class=\"admonition important\">\n    <p class=\"admonition-title\">Important</p>\n    <p style=\"font-size:16px\">Editing at least one character of a template step, will make the step immune to template edits. Say, you want to build a step based on a template. You pull it in by choosing from the templates drop-down, and then add few extra lines to its text in the editor. In such cases, the step is no more linked to the chosen template, and thus will not be affected if the template gets edited on the <a href=\"../Templates/\">Template</a> tab.</p>\n</div>\n<br>\n\n<button class=\"button copy-to-clipboard\" style=\"float: right;\" onclick=\"setClipboard('https://docs.revenuegrid.com/articles/FAQ/#26_what_happens_when_you_edit_a_template')\">Copy link to this question<img src=\"../../assets/images/faq/copy.svg\"></button>\n\n&nbsp;\n* * *\n&nbsp;\n<!-----------------------------BIG----------------------------------->\n<!-----------------------------BIG----------------------------------->\n\n### 27\\. How does the exact time of sending the next email gets calculated?\n\nIt all gets figured out by the state of the art algorithm under the hood. Normally, once a user activates a sequence, all its recipients get queued into one stack which shoots emails and SMS one after another within the selected <a href=\"../Settings/#schedules\">delivery schedule</a> and <a href=\"../Create-new-sequence/#adding_and_editing_steps_toof_a_sequence\">Schedule idle</a>. <i>The general bandwidth is 1 email per minute.</i>\n<br>\n<p>\n    <img src=\"../../assets/images/faq/queue.png\" style=\"margin-left:15px;  float: right; width: 50%; height: 50%;\"/>\n    But there are cases when a user clicks \"Send now\" button or schedules a certain email to be sent at a specific time in the Action Center.\n</p>\n<br><br> \nIn such cases, the queue gets shifted and such email cuts the line to get sent out on demand.\n<br><br>\nAnother factor affects queuing is <a href=\"../Settings/#limits\">email bandwidth limits</a>.<br>\n<p style=\"margin-left:5%;\">\n    For example, if you hit the limit of <i>\"Number of sequence touches a RG user can send per day\"</i>, then the rest of the steps will be sent out not necessarily on the flowing calendar day, but on the following day within sequence's <a href=\"../Settings/#schedules\">delivery schedule</a>.<br><br>\n    \u26a0\ufe0f And there will be a <a href=\"../Next-step/#special_indicators\">special indicator</a> for queued prospects appearing in the <i>Next step</i> column on the <i>Recipients</i> and <i>Audience</i> tabs.\n    <br>\n</p>\n\nTo sum up, the algorithm considers every email's priority, your and your company's <a href=\"../Settings/#limits\">email bandwidth limits</a> and a <i>Sequence's</i> <a href=\"../Settings/#schedules\">delivery schedule</a>, and as an output, builds the most optimized queue to distribute outreaches.\n<br><br>\n\n<button class=\"button copy-to-clipboard\" style=\"float: right;\" onclick=\"setClipboard('https://docs.revenuegrid.com/articles/FAQ/#27_how_does_the_exact_time_of_sending_the_next_email_gets_calculated')\">Copy link to this question<img src=\"../../assets/images/faq/copy.svg\"></button></button>\n\n&nbsp;\n* * *\n&nbsp;\n<!-----------------------------BIG----------------------------------->\t\n<!-----------------------------BIG----------------------------------->\n\n\n### 28\\.

Click Send me a test email and you will receive the email within a minute.\n \n \n Copy link to this question \n \n \n13. How to deal with bounced contacts?\nIt happens that once the first step of a sequence gets executed, you receive several bounced replies. One of the reasons you get bounced replies is email addresses have been misspelled in Salesforce. So what to do in that case? The best practice is:\n \n \n \n 1. Go to the original Sequence->Recipients tab, and filter by \"Bounced\". Now you have a list of exact prospect who have been bounced. \n \n \n \n \n 2. Fix their records in Salesforce or remove unneeded once via the More Options icon\n \n \n \n \n 3. Clone the original Sequence on the Overview tab\n \n \n \n 4.

What happens when you edit a Template?\n<!--\n \n \n \n -->\nBe cautious when you edit a template . Before editing a template, be aware of sequences which have steps built using the template.\n \nWhen a template gets edited, all steps which the template had been used for will be updated seamlessly. Whether the template-based step is automatic , then the updated outreach will be carried out in its timely manner; or the template-based step is manual , then the updated draft will be waiting for you in the Action Center. \n \n Important \n Editing at least one character of a template step, will make the step immune to template edits. Say, you want to build a step based on a template. You pull it in by choosing from the templates drop-down, and then add few extra lines to its text in the editor. In such cases, the step is no more linked to the chosen template, and thus will not be affected if the template gets edited on the Template tab. \n \n \n Copy link to this question \n \n \n27. How does the exact time of sending the next email gets calculated?\nIt all gets figured out by the state of the art algorithm under the hood. Normally, once a user activates a sequence, all its recipients get queued into one stack which shoots emails and SMS one after another within the selected delivery schedule and Schedule idle . The general bandwidth is 1 email per minute. \n \n \n \n But there are cases when a user clicks \"Send now\" button or schedules a certain email to be sent at a specific time in the Action Center.\n \n \nIn such cases, the queue gets shifted and such email cuts the line to get sent out on demand.\n \nAnother factor affects queuing is email bandwidth limits . \n \n For example, if you hit the limit of \"Number of sequence touches a RG user can send per day\" , then the rest of the steps will be sent out not necessarily on the flowing calendar day, but on the following day within sequence's delivery schedule . \n \u26a0\ufe0f And there will be a special indicator for queued prospects appearing in the Next step column on the Recipients and Audience tabs.\n \n \nTo sum up, the algorithm considers every email's priority, your and your company's email bandwidth limits and a Sequence's delivery schedule , and as an output, builds the most optimized queue to distribute outreaches.\n \n Copy link to this question \n \n \n28. How to create a sequence which sends emails only on Thursday?\nSay you need a sequence of three emails to get sent on Thursdays only. The first email on the upcoming Thursday, the second on the following Thursday in a week, and the third email on the Thursday coming after that.\n \nFollow these steps in order to set up such a sequence to reach out your prospects only on a certain day of a week.\n \n \n \n 1. First, you have to have a Delivery Schedule which would be set only to that particular day of the week.\n \n Go to Settings -> Schedule \n Click in the top right-hand corner. \n Create the schedule. \n Read more about creating a schedule .\n \n \n \n \n \n 2. Next, make sure you select this schedule when creating a sequence . \n \n Also you can change an existing sequence's delivery schedule on the Sequence's settings tab .\n \n \n \n \n \n 3. Now, it's time to create the 1st steps of the sequence. \n \n For the first step, make sure you select 0 days in the Schedule Idle field. That way, the Sequence will start sending the first outreach on the closest upcoming Thursday. \n \n \n \n \n \n 4. When creating the 2nd and the 3rd steps though, it's very important to set 1 day in the Schedule Idle field. \n \n If you keep the field at 0, then all 3 emails may get sent out on the same Thursday, and that's what you want to avoid. \n You can modify the value even for the existing steps. Just double click the step on the Overview tab of the sequence, and update the field in the bottom right-hand corner of the editor .\n \n \n \n Copy link to this question \n \n \n29.
