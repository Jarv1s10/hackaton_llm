It automatically inserts recipient-specific piece of data to email and SMS types of steps. \n\n<p style=\"margin-left:2%;\">Merge field feature is available when:</p>\n<p style=\"margin-left:4%;\"> \n - Adding a step to a Sequence<br>\n - Adding emails to CC field (because you can merge an email type of a field)\n - Building a template<br>\n - Building a signature<br>\n - Building an unsubscribe text<br>\n</p>\n<hr>\nFor example this is how merge-fielded email will look when you build it, and how your recipient will see it:\n<img src=\"../../assets/images/Sequences/merge-field-example.png\" style=\"width: 750px; height: 240px;\"/>\n\n<hr>\n\n## Insert a merge field\n\nIn order to insert a merge-field value: <br>\n<p style=\"margin-left:2%;\">1. Put a cursor where auto-inserted value should appear in the message</p>\n<p style=\"margin-left:2%;\">2. Type <b>&lcub;&lcub;</b> to see the drop-down with available variables you can choose from. Alternatively use <b>&lcub;&lcub; &rcub;&rcub;</b> icon on the editor bar.\n<br>\n (insert <a href=\"https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=cpq_merge_fields.htm&type=5\">merge fields</a>) on the text editor toolbar</p>\n<p style=\"margin-left:2%;\">3. Choose what recipient-specific value you want to auto-insert into a mass email. \n</p>\n<p>The value gets retrieved from Salesforce (recipient-specific data) or Revenue Grid (sender-specific data such as signature, campaign unsubscribe link, and more).\n</p>\n\n  *Commonly used merge-field examples:* Lead/Contact Salutation, Full name and Company name, [RE Sequence](../Sequences/) starter's (Owner's) name and [RE email signature](../Settings/#signatures), [sequence unsubscribe link](../Settings/#the_unsubscribe_section), etc.\n\n<br>\n<div class=\"admonition hint\">\n<p class=\"admonition-title\">Note</p>\n<p>When you use &lcub;&lcub;Sender Phone Number&rcub;&rcub; type of a merge field, Revenue Grid will pull sender's mobile number if available. In case if Mobile field is not populated, then it will show number set in Phone field.</p>\n</div>\n\n<hr>\n\n## Troubleshoot broken merge fields\n\n<p> <img src=\"../../assets/images/faq/merge_preview.png\" style=\"margin-left:15px;  float: right; width: 50%; height: 50%;\">\n To check a merge field's validity, you need to switch the editor to <b>Preview mode</b> (use tabs below the editor). Then, choose a recipient from \"To:\" field drop-down (if you haven't added recipients to the sequence yet, then \"To:\" field will show John Doe as a placeholder) whom you want to preview the end result for. In preview mode, invalid merge fields get highlighted with red color.\n</p>\n\nWhile processing an email type of a Step, Revenue Grid checks whether all merge field's values are available. Some may not be available due to empty values in Salesforce, wrong syntactic, no API access etc. If a value is missing for a specific prospect, then an automated email containing it will not be sent to the prospect. Instead, it will be moved to [Action Center](../Planner/)'s To-Dos tab and hang on there until handled manually.  \n\nThe best practice to fix it, is to populate the missing field (highlighted red) on the recipients' file in Salesforce. Otherwise, remove the merge field tag from the message.\n<br>\n<hr>\n\n## Use If-Then-Else logic to replace missing fields with alternative values\n<br>\nWhile personalizing a mass message, you should merge in a field from Salesforce. When a field is blank for a certain prospect though, utilize if-then-else expression.\n\n<b>Example:</b>\n\nExpected result: \"Dear John...\", or when name field is blank, simply \"Dear Customer...\".\n<br><br>\nRegular expression: \"Dear &lcub;&lcub;Name&rcub;&rcub;...\" which will cause <i>Merge Field Issue</i> in cases when <i>Name</i> field is blank for a prospect. Go to the Action Center's To-do tab to fix such issue manually. Until you fix the issue, a prospect will hang on there and will not proceed to the next step of a Sequence.\n<br><br>\nSmart expression: \"Dear &lcub;&lcub;#if Name&rcub;&rcub;&lcub;&lcub;Name&rcub;&rcub;&lcub;&lcub;#else&rcub;&rcub;Customer&lcub;&lcub;/if&rcub;&rcub;\"\n<br><br>\n\n<p> <img src=\"../../assets/images/Sequences/if-merge.gif\" style=\"margin-left:15px;  float: right; width: 70%; height: 70%;\">\nThe most convenient way to use the smart expression is, type the \"#\" symbol, and choose the value you want to insert.\n<br>\n</p>\n<br>\n<hr>\n\n## Awesome Merge Field options: \n\n<b>Part of the day</b> merge field: Say you start your outreach with a greeting like \"Good &lcub;&lcub;part_of_the_day&rcub;&rcub;\", Revenue Grid will pull a value among \"morning\", \"afternoon\", or \"evening\" depending on when exactly the email is being sent off taking into consideration the recipient's time zone:\n\n* \"morning\" \u2013 from 12 AM to 12 PM\n* \"afternoon\" \u2013 from 12 PM to 4 PM\n* \"evening\" \u2013 from 4 PM to 12 AM\n\n<br>\n<b>Last step day</b> merge field: Use this merge field when you want to refer to the previous outreach within a sequence. It works best with Follow-up type of steps. Case use: You have an email type of a step which has been executed on the previous Thursday. The next step in the sequence can have this merge field and look like \"I emailed you on &lcub;&lcub;last_step_day&rcub;&rcub;, but never heard back.\" The recipient will see this: \"I emailed you on Thursday, but never heard back.\"<br>\nNote that <b>Last step day</b> merge field will work only if the previous step was executed.\n\n<br>\n<b>Book me link</b> merge field: Adds personal Book me link to the email. Depending on <a href=\"../Settings-of-Sequences/#sending\">whose behalf the sequence is being run</a>, you can add &lcub;&lcub;Owner BookMe Text&rcub;&rcub; or &lcub;&lcub;Sender BookMe Text&rcub;&rcub;. Go to settings to <a href=\"../Settings/#bookme_text\">set up your personal Book me link</a>.\n<br>\n<hr>\n\n## Extra BookMe and Unsubscribe links\n\n<p> <img src=\"../../assets/images/10082021/extra-book-me-link.png\" style=\"margin-left:15px;  float: right; width: 70%; height: 70%;\">\nYou can add extra book me or unsubscribe links to your email steps. Those links will be associated with the sequence, for complex link tracking and performance measurements.\n</p>\n<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>\n<hr>\n\n## Available Merge Field values\n\n<b>Possible recipient-specific values pulled from Salesforce</b>\n\n|||      |      |\n| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |\n|\tFirst Name\t|\tMailing City\t|\tPhoto URL\t|\tLead Source\t|\n|\tLast Name\t|\tMailing State/Province\t|\tClean Status\t|\tStatus\t|\n|\tFull Name\t|\tMailing Zip/Postal Code\t|\tLevel\t|\tIndustry\t|\n|\tTitle\t|\tMailing Country\t|\tLanguages\t|\tRating\t|\n|\tLinkedIn\t|\tMailing Latitude\t|\tDeleted\t|\tAnnual Revenue\t|\n|\tPhone Number\t|\tMailing Longitude\t|\tSalutation\t|\tEmployees\t|\n|\tSkype\t|\tMailing Geocode Accuracy\t|\tCompany\t|\tConverted\t|\n|\tBuilding\t|\tBusiness Phone\t|\tStreet\t|\tConverted Date\t|\n|\tApartment\t|\tBusiness Fax\t|\tCity\t|\tUnread By Owner\t|\n|\tZip\t|\tHome Phone\t|\tState/Province\t|\tCreated Date\t|\n|\tTimeZone\t|\tOther Phone\t|\tZip/Postal Code\t|\tLast Modified Date\t|\n|\tOther Street\t|\tAsst.
