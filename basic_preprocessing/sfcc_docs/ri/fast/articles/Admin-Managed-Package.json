The package was previously known as the *{{ company_name }}* managed package.\n\n**You can get the latest version of the managed package here:**   \n<https://login.salesforce.com/packaging/installPackage.apexp?p0=04t1P000000ElXz>\n\n**Managed package for Professional Salesforce edition:**\n<https://login.salesforce.com/packaging/installPackage.apexp?p0=04t1P0000006KNH>\n\nThe Publisher name of the package *InvisibleCRM* is an old brand name of {{ company_name }}.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nBesides providing the auxiliary elements, the managed package enables {{ company_name }} controls integration into Salesforce user account interface, using a [custom Salesforce Canvas app mechanism](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.platform_connect.meta/platform_connect/canvas_framework_intro.htm). This possibility is available for both [Salesforce Classic UI and Salesforce Lightning Experience](https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=lex_aloha_comparison.htm&type=5).  \n\n&nbsp;\n\n!!! note \"Note\"\n    The managed package is guaranteed to be secure, confidential, and free of any malicious content, under [{{ company_name }} Privacy & Security policies](../Privacy-and-Security/)\n\n&nbsp;\n\n!!! note \"Note\"\n    If the error \"*This package can't be installed*\" occurred on the managed package installation to the [Salesforce Professional Edition](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.overview_edition.htm&type=5), refer to [this article](../managed-package-installation-failed/) to learn how to handle the issue\n\n&nbsp;\n\n* * *\n\n&nbsp;\n\n#### The extra features provided by the package\n\n**1\\.** The possibility to dock [{{ product_name }}](../Introduction/) into a user's Salesforce page, this way enabling various scenarios of convenient emails and calendar data handling directly from users' Salesforce accounts. It is implemented as a [Salesforce Canvas](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.platform_connect.meta/platform_connect/canvas_framework_intro.htm) pane; such panes are used to add various visual pages to Salesforce user interface\n\n!!! tip \"Tip\"\n    Another use for the [Salesforce Canvas](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.platform_connect.meta/platform_connect/canvas_framework_intro.htm) component is to make [{{ product_name }} Admin Panel](../How-to-Log-In-to-the-Admin-Panel/) settings faster to access and manage for the local Admin users, by docking the Admin panel as a Canvas pane onto their Salesforce pages\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**2\\.** The package includes an extended set of custom object fields required for using the complete [revenue intelligence package {{ company_name }}](https://docs.revenuegrid.com/) as well as for advanced {{ product_name }} features, e.g. [Engagement logging in Salesforce](../How-to-Use-SCC-Engagement-Panel-%28Adaptive-view%29/#engagement_data_logging_in_salesforce). That also covers some of the fields and components added by the [older Invisible Suite managed package](../Admin-Managed-Package/#specific_fields_classes_and_components_the_revenue_inbox_package_adds_to_your_salesforce_configuration)\n\n**3\\.** Direct and handy [Salesforce reports](https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=rd_reports_overview.htm&type=5) access and use. With this component installed, the end users will be able to use a pre-configured set of [Salesforce reports](../Salesforce-Reports/) or [customize reports](https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=reports_defining_report_types.htm&type=5) to be used for their specific needs\n\n**4\\.** For [Revenue Engage revenue intelligence platform](https://docs.revenuegrid.com/) users, the package allows to dock Revenue Engage tabs straight into their Salesforce user interface, as [Visualforce components](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/en/content/learn/modules/visualforce_fundamentals)\n\n<details><summary> >>> Click to see a screenshot <<< </summary>\n<p><img src=\"..\\..\\assets\\images\\Configuration-&-Settings\\Admin-Settings-&-Actions\\RE-tabs.png\" class=\"minimized\">\n</p></details>\n\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n* * *\n\n&nbsp;\n\n#### I. Install {{ company_name }} managed package\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**1.** Make sure that you have set up [My Domain](http://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=domain_name_overview.htm&type=5) name for your Salesforce Org and Deployed it to Users.
