Selective automatic synchronizing of Tasks with Salesforce offered by {{ product_name }} is highly useful for jobs reporting and coordination.\n\nAfter [{{ short_company_name }} sync is set up](../Authorizing-Sync-Engine-to-Work-with-Your-Data/), to enable Tasks down-syncing from Salesforce to your mail client, go to the **Sync Settings** page (see the article [Opening the Dashboard](../How-to-Open-Sync-Dashboard-(Adaptive-view)/)), on the General subtab, enable the **Sync my Salesforce tasks** switch button in the Tasks block:\n\n<p><img src=\"..\\..\\assets\\images\\Configuration-&-Settings\\User-Settings\\contacts-sync\\tasks-sync.png\">\n</p>\n\n&nbsp;\n\nNote that your Tasks existing in MS Exchange / Office 365 prior to {{ short_name }} sync activation will **not** be synced with Salesforce, unless you specifically select them to be synced using either one of the methods described below:\n\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\n#### Saving a Task in Salesforce\n\nYou can save an MS Exchange / Office 365 Task in Salesforce in one of the following ways:\n\n*   By assigning the task the custom *Salesforce* category. In this case on the following sync session the task will be saved in Salesforce and automatically moved to the *Salesforce Tasks* folder\n*   By moving the task to the dedicated *Salesforce Tasks* folder.
