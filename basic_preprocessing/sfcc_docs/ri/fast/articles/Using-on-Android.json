For this reason it is recommended to [enable automatic syncing of new Appointments and Meetings](../Configuring-Activities-Synchronization-Settings/#automatic_syncing_of_calendar_items_events_autosharing) if you intend to use {{ product_name }} on mobile devices most of the time \n- Since [Compose mode](../Saving-Emails-in-Salesforce-2.-Ways-to-Save-an-Email-(Adaptive-view)/) is not available in MS Outlook Mobile implementation, email saving behavior and the flow of the [Send meeting time slots](../How-to-Send-Meeting-Time-Slots-(Adaptive-view)/) and [Share calendar availability](../Sharing-Calendar-Availability-(Adaptive-view)/) features are more basic; for the latter case pre-defined non-modifiable [Salesforce templates](https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=email_templates_lightning_parent.htm&type=5) are used to populate invite emails' bodies   \n- Another limitation of the mobile implementation on both iOS and Android is the impossibility to save files attached to emails or calendar items in Salesforce: a *\"Something wrong happened. Attachments were not saved\"* notification appears if you attempt doing that\n\n\n\n&#160;\n &#160;\n\n",

For this reason it is recommended to enable automatic syncing of new Appointments and Meetings if you intend to use {{ product_name }} on mobile devices most of the time \nSince Compose mode is not available in MS Outlook Mobile implementation, email saving behavior and the flow of the Send meeting time slots and Share calendar availability features are more basic; for the latter case pre-defined non-modifiable Salesforce templates are used to populate invite emails' bodies \nAnother limitation of the mobile implementation on both iOS and Android is the impossibility to save files attached to emails or calendar items in Salesforce: a \"Something wrong happened. Attachments were not saved\" notification appears if you attempt doing that\n&#160;\n &#160;"
