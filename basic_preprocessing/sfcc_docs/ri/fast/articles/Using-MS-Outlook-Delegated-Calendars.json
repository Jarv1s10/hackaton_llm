It only allows viewing calendar entries; no item saving in Salesforce or linking to Salesforce objects is possible with this permissions type.\n\nManaging calendar entries using the delegated calendars feature with {{ product_name }} Add-In requires Author or Editor permissions to be set up: **File > Info tab** **> Account Settings > Delegate Access > Calendar** picklist.\n\n![](../assets/images/d33v4339jhl8k0cloudfrontnet/docs/assets/57398d2e903360669faf1f0a/images/5b7ec4650428631d7a8a4e7f.png)\n\n&nbsp;\n\n![](../assets/images/d33v4339jhl8k0cloudfrontnet/docs/assets/57398d2e903360669faf1f0a/images/5b7daade0428631d7a8a471b.png)\n\n&nbsp;\n\nDelegated calendar permissions can be set up individually: **{MS Outlook Calendar view} > Folder** tab **> Calendar Properties**\n\n![](../assets/images/d33v4339jhl8k0cloudfrontnet/docs/assets/57398d2e903360669faf1f0a/images/5b7dab122c7d3a03f89e0315.png)\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe required permissions level for {{ product_name }} delegated calendars management are **Can edit** or **Delegate**.\n\n![](../assets/images/d33v4339jhl8k0cloudfrontnet/docs/assets/57398d2e903360669faf1f0a/images/5b7ec68d0428631d7a8a4eca.png)\n\n&nbsp;\n\n!!! note \"Note\"\n    The **Delegate can see my private items** or **Can view private events** setting allows a Delegate with Editor or Author permissions to view as well as modify items which the calendar Organizer [marked as private](http://support.office.com/en-us/article/make-an-appointment-or-meeting-private-dc3898f0-22f5-45c6-8cc8-b4d4db84111d). With this setting enabled a Delegate can also remove the _private_ mark from calendar items\n\n&nbsp;\n\n* * *\n\n&nbsp;\n\n#### Setting Up Shared Calendar Access in Salesforce\n\nIn order to allow Events in the Organizer's Salesforce calendar to be created or modified by {{ product_name }} via a Delegate's Salesforce account the necessary shared calendar permissions should also be set up in Salesforce. Refer to the following Salesforce help articles to learn how to do that: [article 1](https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=calendar_sharing_parent.htm&type=5); [article 2](https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=000327324&type=1&mode=1).\n\n&nbsp;\n\n* * *\n\n&nbsp;\n\n#### Delegated Calendar Items Syncing in Salesforce\n\n&nbsp;\n\nTo sync a delegated calendar item in Salesforce (initial sharing), you can either assign it the blue Salesforce category in MS Outlook or [find and select](../Searching-for-Existing-Salesforce-Records-and-Creating-New-Records-(Adaptive-view)/) a relevant existing record and then click the [**Save** button](../Save-Email-Dialog/) at the top of {{ product_name }}. If [{{ short_name }} insta-sync is enabled](../Synchronization-Engine-An-Overview/#instant_sync_of_calendar_items), an item shared this way will be saved in Salesforce instantly.

For this scenario: items cannot be in compose more.
