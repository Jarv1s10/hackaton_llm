At that, users' data from MS Exchange accounts can be handled using [{{ company_name }} synchronization](../Synchronization-Engine-An-Overview/), through [auto-saving](../Configuring-Activities-Synchronization-Settings/#automatic_syncing_of_calendar_items_events_autosharing) or the custom \"Salesforce\" category / folder / list, as described in this article\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\n{{ product_name }} allows teams to collaborate on-the-go within their Salesforce Orgs, by saving business Contacts, Emails, Calendar events, and Tasks in Salesforce right from personal smartphone or tablet devices with MS Outlook Mobile or On the Web running. Similarly, Contacts and other Salesforce records, Tasks, or Calendar Appointments can be instantly created, updated, or processed via the Sidebar; all additions and changes get automatically mirrored two-way between mail server and Salesforce through server-side [{{ short_name }} Sync Engine](../Synchronization-Engine-An-Overview/). \n\nIf your device has a high enough screen resolution, for example you are using a tablet, you may also effectively use the full rendition of [{{ product_name }}](../Introduction/) in MS Outlook on the Web in a [supported mobile browser](../Frequently-Asked-Questions/#supported_browsers_with_outlook_on_the_web).\n\n&nbsp;\n\n## Handling Business Communication Data via an iPhone Device\n\nTo save an Email, Contact, or Task in Salesforce from a mobile device, you may use the basic methods provided by {{ short_name }} Sync Engine or the [Save button](../Save-Email-Dialog/) provided by the mobile rendition of {{ short_name }} [Outlook Add-In](../Introduction/).\n\n&nbsp;\n\nYou may also use other [{{ product_name }} ](../Introduction/) functions in its mobile rendition on MS Outlook for iOS or Android: create or search Salesforce records, schedule Time Slots or Book Me meetings, etc.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n### In MS Outlook for iOS\n\nUse prerequisites:\n\n- [Install the Add-In](../How-to-Install-and-Run-the-Solution-for-Office-365-Mailboxes/) for your email account\n- [Activate {{ short_name }} Sync](../Authorizing-Sync-Engine-to-Work-with-Your-Data/)\n\nAlso refer to [this article](../How-to-Install-the-Solution-using-a-Mobile-Device/) to learn how to install the Add-In via MS Outlook for iOS if it wasn't installed.\n\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n#### Saving Outlook Emails from iPhone\n\n{{ product_name }} processes to Salesforce <u>only</u> Emails marked this way, this excludes the risks that your personal Emails might get synced there from your mobile.\n\nEmails can be saved in one of the following ways, only in [Read mode](../Saving-Emails-in-Salesforce-2.-Ways-to-Save-an-Email-%28Adaptive-view%29/):\n\n- using the Save button in the mobile rendition of [{{ product_name }}](../Introduction/)\n- using basic Sync Engine means \u2013 the custom *Salesforce Emails* folder\n\n&nbsp;\n\n##### Emails saving via the Save button\n\nThis method has the following advantages: you can set what records to link to the saved item in Salesforce and edit the resulting item's key fields *Subject*, *Priority*, *Status*, etc. via [Save dialog](../Save-Email-Dialog/); saving is performed immediately.\n\nTo save an email:\n\n**1\\.** In MS Outlook Mobile folders Inbox or Sent, select a business email your want to save in Salesforce  \n\n**2\\.** Tap the **\u2022\u2022\u2022** (Menu) icon on the top and select **Open {{ company_name }}**  \n\n  <details><summary>>>> Click to see a screenshot <<<</summary>\n    <p>\n        <img src=\"..\\..\\assets\\images\\Using-SmartCloud-Connect\\Mobile\\iPhone\\Emails\\emails31.png\" style=\"width: 65%; height: 65%;\">\n    </p>\n    </details>\n&nbsp;\n\n**3\\.** The home screen of the mobile rendition of [{{ product_name }}](../Introduction/) will be opened.

As soon as an email from the dedicated folder is saved, it gets the custom \"Salesforce Email\" category. Feel free to move saved emails back to Inbox or Sent folders from the dedicated folder after they are saved.\nIf the dedicated folder method is used, emails get saved linked to [auto-retrieved related records](../Initial-Search-and-Applied-Record-Filters/#the_resulting_related_records_list_will_include).\n\n**Method 1.** \n\nTap, hold and drag the needed business email to the right, then put it into the **Salesforce Emails** folder.\n\n  <details><summary>>>> Click to see the screenshots <<<</summary>\n    <p>\n        <img src=\"..\\..\\assets\\images\\Using-SmartCloud-Connect\\Mobile\\iPhone\\Emails\\emails10.png\" style=\"width: 65%; height: 65%;\">\n    <br>\n    <br>\n    <br>\n        <img src=\"..\\..\\assets\\images\\Using-SmartCloud-Connect\\Mobile\\iPhone\\Emails\\emails11.png\" style=\"width: 65%; height: 65%;\">\n    </p>\n    </details>\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Method 2.
