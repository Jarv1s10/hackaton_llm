To prevent saving of items not intended to be saved in Salesforce, {{ short_name }} includes two layers of blocklisting based on email address or email domains:\n\n- [Org-wide blocklisting](../Special-Admin-Panel-Settings/#emails_domains_blocklisted_from_sync) (managed via the [Admin panel](../How-to-Log-In-to-the-Admin-Panel/)). This blocklist is used to exclude spam, newsletters, and other unwanted emails from being saved in Salesforce by the users; internal (in-org) domains and addresses are also appended to it\n- [User-defined blocklisting](../Configuring-Activities-Synchronization-Settings/#blocklisting_email_addresses_and_domains) (managed via [individual Sync settings](../How-to-Open-Sync-Dashboard-(Adaptive-view)/)). This blocklist is used to exclude personal communication and meetings/appointments as well as personal newsletters from being saved in Salesforce\n\nBy default, these blocklists are combined for every individual user and users can remove addresses/domains set on the Admin level from the congregated blocklist.\n\nAdditionaly, if a company uses several internal email domains (e.g., *successteam.com*, *success.team*, *successteam.io*), it is impossible to remove these email domains from the blocklist. If admins manually remove any internal email domain in the *ServiceAutoTrackBlackList* setting, on refreshing the Settings page, the deleted email domain will be restored in the blocklist. This is the default designed behavior.\n\nThe same happens when a user removes internal domain(s) from their individual Blocklist in {{ short_company_name }} Sync Settings, the deleted domain(s) reappear in the Blocklist after some time.\n\n!!! note \"Note\"\n    Per [customer's request](mailto:support@revenuegrid.com) (option available for Enterprise users only), this behavior can be adjusted so that addresses/domains set by the Admin will be impossible to remove from the blocklist via the users' [individual Synchronization setting](../Configuring-Activities-Synchronization-Settings/#blocklisting_email_addresses_and_domains)\n\n&nbsp;\n\n!!! note \"Note\"\n    Besides the org-wide and user-defined blocklisting described above, another blocklist feature is configured in {{ short_name }}. A special global setting blocklists all free email services (e.g. *gmail.com*, *yahoo.com*, etc.) from [auto-syncing](../Configuring-Activities-Synchronization-Settings/#automatic_saving_of_emails_emails_autosharing) by default.
