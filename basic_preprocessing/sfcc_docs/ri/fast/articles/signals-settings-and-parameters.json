It enlists the available configurable Revenue signals, their descriptions, parameters, and templates.    \n&nbsp;\n  \nRevenue Signals are manually or automatically created alerts for sales representatives that notify about important occurrences and overall deal progress. They ensure that no event, email, or status change remains unnoticed or unreplied.    \n  \n  \nWhen a deal reaches a specific stage or a critical occurrence takes place (a new email received, a meeting invite is unresponded for a particular number of days, etc.), signals notify the accountable employees about that and suggest the next steps to take. \n\nBesides the signals enabled by default and manually created signals, {{ company_name }} Intelligence package includes a flexible Signal Builder for creating custom signals of specific types. Below, you can find the detailed overview of the available signals presets, their configurable parameters, and sample templates. The enlisted signals presets are available by default.\n\n&nbsp;  \n\n!!! tip \"Tip\"  \n    Refer to [this article](https://docs.revenuegrid.com/articles/Signals/) for an overview of Revenue signals for end users and to [this {{ short_name }} article](../revenue-signals/) to learn how to manage signals directly from your email client    \n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n***\n&nbsp;\n\n## 1. Chosen conditions met for the Salesforce object\n  \n\n**Description**\n\nThis signal will be triggered when the chosen object meets all configured conditions.  \n  \nThe generic Salesforce check job is intended to collect Salesforce objects which match the predefined filter and generate a signal for each of such objects.      \n  \n\n<p> \n<img src=\"..\\..\\assets\\images\\Internal-Use\\signals-parameters\\chosen-conditions-met-for-the-salesforce-object.png\" class=\"minimized\">\n</p>\n&nbsp;\n\n<table data-layout=\"default\">\n    <tbody>\n        <tr>\n            <th colspan=\"2\">\n                <h3>Parameters</h3>\n            </th>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>\n                <h4><strong>Trigger</strong></h4>\n                <ul>\n                    <li>\n                        <p>Enabled \u2013 default value \u2013 True</p>\n                    </li>\n                    <li>\n                        <p>Affected object:</p>\n                        <ul>\n                            <li>\n                                <p>Lead</p>\n                            </li>\n                            <li>\n                                <p>Contact</p>\n                            </li>\n                            <li>\n                                <p>Opportunity</p>\n                            </li>\n                            <li>\n                                <p>Account</p>\n                            </li>\n                        </ul>\n                    </li>\n                    <li>\n                        <p>Recipient:</p>\n                        <ul>\n                            <li>\n                                <p>Object Owner</p>\n                            </li>\n                            <li>\n                                <p>Manager</p>\n                            </li>\n                            <li>\n                                <p>Users</p>\n                            </li>\n                        </ul>\n                    </li>\n                    <li>\n                        <p>Object filter SOQL (Mandatory)</p>\n                    </li>\n                </ul>\n            </td>\n            <td>\n                <h4><strong>Action</strong></h4>\n                <ul>\n                    <li>\n                        <p>Score \u2013 default value \u2013 &quot;-1&quot;</p>\n                    </li>\n                    <li>\n                        <p>Dismiss the signal automatically after (hours) \u2013 default value \u2013&nbsp; 336</p>\n                    </li>\n                    <li>\n                        <p>Notification title (Mandatory)</p>\n                    </li>\n                    <li>\n                        <p>Signal destinations:</p>\n                        <ul>\n                            <li>\n                                <p>Action Center \u2013 default value \u2013 True, read only</p>\n                            </li>\n                            <li>\n                                <p>Email \u2013 default value \u2013 True</p>\n                            </li>\n                            <li>\n                                <p>MS Teams&nbsp; \u2013 default value \u2013 True</p>\n                            </li>\n                        </ul>\n                    </li>\n                </ul>\n            </td>\n        </tr>\n    </tbody>\n</table>\n\n\n<details><summary>Click to see the Configurable Parameters</summary>  \n\n<h3>Configurable Parameters</h3>\n<p>Configuration parameters are stored in the <strong>GenericSalesforceCheckConfiguration</strong> table in the signals database.</p>\n\n<table data-layout=\"default\">\n    <tbody>\n        <tr>\n            <th>\n                <h3>Parameter</h3>\n            </th>\n            <th>\n                <p>Description</p>\n            </th>\n            <th>\n                <p>Default value</p>\n            </th>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>\n                <p>ContextUserId</p>\n            </td>\n            <td>\n                <p>Signals User ID that will be used to query data from Salesforce.

It enlists the available configurable Revenue signals, their descriptions, parameters, and templates. \nRevenue Signals are manually or automatically created alerts for sales representatives that notify about important occurrences and overall deal progress. They ensure that no event, email, or status change remains unnoticed or unreplied. \nWhen a deal reaches a specific stage or a critical occurrence takes place (a new email received, a meeting invite is unresponded for a particular number of days, etc.), signals notify the accountable employees about that and suggest the next steps to take. \nBesides the signals enabled by default and manually created signals, {{ company_name }} Intelligence package includes a flexible Signal Builder for creating custom signals of specific types. Below, you can find the detailed overview of the available signals presets, their configurable parameters, and sample templates. The enlisted signals presets are available by default.\n \n!!! tip \"Tip\"\n Refer to this article for an overview of Revenue signals for end users and to this {{ short_name }} article to learn how to manage signals directly from your email client \n1.
