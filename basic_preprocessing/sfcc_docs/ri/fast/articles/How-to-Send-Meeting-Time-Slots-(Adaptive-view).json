As soon as a recipient clicks on their preferred slot, {{ product_name }} checks if the slot is still available in the organizer's calendar. In case it is occupied by another reservation, the recipient is suggested to pick another slot. In addition, by refreshing booking page browser window, the recipient can actualize the table after such checks.\n\nTime Slots links can be generated even if [{{ short_name }} Sync Engine](../Synchronization-Engine-An-Overview/) is not running; however, in this case, the resulting meetings cannot be synced in the Salesforce calendar till [syncing is resumed](../Handling-Sync-Issues/).\n\n&nbsp;\n    \n!!! tip \"Tip\"\n    See [this article](../Time-Slots-Gmail/) to learn how to use the Time Slots feature in [{{ short_name }} Chrome Extension](../Using-the-Solution-for-Salesforce-and-Gmail/)\n\n<!--\n<iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/392007175\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n-->\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n* * *\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n## Time Slots links generation steps\n\nTo schedule a meeting via the via {{ short_name }} Meeting Scheduler by sharing your preferred time slots through an interactive invitation:\n\n<p>\n    <img src=\"..\\..\\assets\\images\\Using-SmartCloud-Connect\\How-To-s\\Sharing-Calendar-Availability-(Adaptive-view)\\rg-open-ribbon.png\" style=\"width:39.29%; display:inline-block; vertical-align:middle; margin-left:1px;float: right\">\n</p>\n\n**1\\.** Open an email from/to recipient(s) which you want to initiate a meeting with or create a new email message by clicking the **New email** or the **Reply** button in MS Outlook ribbon and specify one or multiple recipients in the To, Cc, or BCC fields.
