    "text_content": "description: Detailed overview of Customization Settings in RG Email Sidebar\n{{ product_name }} Customization Settings Explained\n For users of the Email Sidebar on: \n \n \n \n13 min read \n \n \n \n!!! note \"Note\"\n Some Customization features require adding certain auxiliary fields and classes to Salesforce objects; to get them added automatically ask your local Salesforce administrator to install the {{ company_name }} managed package in your Org \u2013 it will enable the full scope of {{ short_name }} features on Salesforce side\n \nIn the latest {{ short_name }} updates Customization page was converted to a tab in {{ company_name }} web platform; its look and functions remained the same.\n \n \n \n \n{{ product_name }} Customization page allows the individual users to adjust various aspects of interaction between Salesforce and {{ short_name }} Outlook Add-In / Chrome Extension. This includes viewing, processing, and search patterns for different types of objects and their fields, see the left and central panes of the page.\nAlso, here you can adjust the appearance and various functional settings of {{ product_name }} for individual users, using the controls on the right pane of the page.\n!!! tip \"Tip\"\n After adjusting customization settings make sure to click Save in the upper right corner of the page to apply the changes\n!!! warning \"Important\"\n To discard any recent changes you made, you can click Discard changes. However, once an updated customization is saved by clicking the Save button, you can only Reset to default settings, so no other previous sets of settings can be restored\n!!! note \"Note\"\n Since some {{ short_name }} Outlook Add-In features are not available in {{ short_name }} Chrome Extension, their associated settings cannot be managed in {{ short_name }} Customization settings of {{ short_name }} implementation for Gmail\n1. How to Open Customization Page\n \n \n \nClick the \u2630 (Menu) button in the header of {{ product_name }} and then select Customization to open {{ product_name }} Customization settings page in your web browser.\n \n2. Application Settings\nThe controls in the right pane of Customization page enable you to adjust the range of settings defining various aspects of the Add-In\u2019s / Chrome Extension\u2019s behavior.\nRefer to this article for complete information on Application Settings in {{ short_name }} Customization Settings.\n3. Duplicates for Objects Linking\nRefer to this article for complete information on the Allow creating duplicated emails in Salesforce setting and the Allow creating email duplicates to be linked to these object types field which makes this setting more flexible.\nAlso see this article for information on objects linking mechanics.\n!!! warning \"Important\"\n Please note that if you adjust the duplicate handling settings, for these changes to be applied you must log out from {{ product_name }} Add-In and then re-log in\n4. Defining Record Associations (Smart Linking)\nIn {{ short_name }} Customization settings, you can adjust Add-In / Chrome Extension behavior when it processes new emails or events.\nRefer to this article for complete information on Defining Record Associations.\n5. Choosing a Set of Salesforce Objects to Display\n!!! note \"Note\"\n In case your Org uses custom object types, refer to this article to learn how to configure their handling in {{ product_name }}\nTo change the set of Salesforce objects handled via {{ product_name }}, by enabling object types in the left pane: \n5.1. Use the Quick Find field to search for the needed Salesforce object\n \n \n \n5.2. After an object is selected, its object card will appear in the central pane Objects in {{ product_name }}. If necessary, adjust the fields and settings on the card to customize how this object will be handled\n \n \n \n!!! warning \"Important\"\n To ensure the proper functioning of the {{ short_name }} Add-In, at least one object should be selected in the Objects in Salesforce list. If no object is selected, the Save button in the Sidebar will grey out and become unclickable, and you will not be able to save any emails or events\n6. Customizing Object Card Appearance and Behavior\nYou can set up how object cards appear and behave in {{ product_name }} by making the following adjustments on the Customization page (the central column Objects in {{ product_name }}). These settings are defined specifically for every object type enabled in {{ product_name }} handling scope; note that some custom objects require additional configuring to be handled by {{ product_name }}.\n6.1. Selecting which fields to show\nYou can have up to four object fields shown on an unexpanded card. To define which fields to show, pick the needed field names in the list; to remove an unneeded field use the X icon.\n \n \n \n6.2. Specifying card sort order\nUse the Sort by picklist to set the order in which object cards will appear on the Sidebar's home screen or in search results.\n \n \n \n6.3. Defining the search/view scope\nTo get focused results, {{ product_name }} Add-in applies custom Salesforce views (filters) when searching for records, and you can specify which filter you want to be applied for every object type, by selecting them in the Global search filter picklist.\n \n \n \nFor example, if you want {{ product_name }} to search only among the Accounts created by you, set My Accounts in the picklist opened for the Accounts type in Customization page's central pane \n!!! tip \"Tip\"\n Besides the pre-set views you can add your own custom created Salesforce views \u2013 {{ product_name }} will automatically take up all custom list views you create in Salesforce\nBesides this general scope focusing mechanism, you can also set additional filtering to be applied on handling of specific types of records in the Sidebar, using the Contextual search filter setting.\n \n \n \nContextual search filter also uses pre-set or custom created views, to focus Related and searched for records in the Sidebar, based on specific field values criteria, e.g. Status, Created date, Priority, etc. For example, if the Default {{ product_name }} filter is set for Opportunity objects, only non-closed Opportunities are shown and handled by {{ short_name }}, but if you want to make this scope focused according to your needs, you can create your own view according to your preferences and apply it.\nThe animation below demonstrates how to change the view filters for different object types\n \n \n \nDefault {{ product_name }} filters\nThere is a selection of pre-set Global view filters available for every object type that suit various records filtering needs, most of them are the standard pre-set Salesforce views, but some are peculiar to {{ product_name }}. In the latter case, to see a default filter's criteria hover the mouse over it in the picklist.\n!!! warning \"Important\"\n Note that the default {{ product_name }} filters are not the same as the Default filters you use in Salesforce. In addition, for some types like Email messages or Tasks the default Contextual search selection is Do not search\nThe table of object type-specific Default {{ product_name }} filters' parameters for your reference:\n| Object type | Default Global filter parameters | Default Contextual filter value |\n| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------- |\n| EmailMessage | All EmailMessages created no more than 100 days in the past | Do not search |\n| Task | All Tasks created no more than 100 days in the past | Do not search |\n| Event | All Events created no more than 365 in the past or scheduled within 100 days in the future | Do not search |\n| Attachment | All Attachments | Do not search |\n| Content document | All Content documents | Do not search |\n| | | |\n| Account | All Accounts | n/a |\n| Lead | All Leads not converted to Contacts | n/a |\n| Contact | All Contacts | n/a |\n| Case | Only non-closed Cases created no more than 90 days in the past | user defined |\n| Opportunity | Only non-closed Opportunities whose Closing date is due no more than 365 days in the past or in the feature | user defined |\n| User | Only Active users in the Org | n/a |\n| Product | All Products | Do not search |\n| Price book | All Price books | Do not search |\n!!! warning \"Important\"\n Both user-initiated search and initial search results are affected by this filter. To avoid confusion, refer to this article for special considerations about using this filter\n6.4. The Search by list\nThis customization setting allows to define what object fields are used both when {{ product_name }} retrieves existing associated records and when you are searching for a certain record of this type. Refer to this article to learn how to use this setting.\n \n \n \n6.5. Allow creating or updating records\nSelect the Allow create or Allow update checkboxes to allow selected card type objects to be created or updated, respectively, via record cards.\n \n \n \n!!! warning \"Important\"\n This checkbox is completely unrelated to Salesforce permissions \u2013 it only adds an additional permissions level within {{ product_name }}. For example, if a user is not allowed to create or update Lead records in Salesforce, one will not be able to create or update these records regardless of this setting's status \n!!! note \"Note\"\n The Account type opened in the central pane has an additional setting Allow create Person Accounts, which is displayed if Salesforce Person Accounts are enabled in your Org. When enabled, this setting allows Person Accounts to be created via {{ short_name }}\n \n \n \n6.6. Hiding record cards in search results (Hide on search)\nYou can select object types not to be displayed in {{ product_name }} search results. Enabling this setting also removes selected object types from related records list.\n \n \n \n \n7. Changing Card Order and Pinning Cards\nYou can adjust the cards' order in the Sidebar by either dragging them in the list or by clicking the \u2022\u2022\u2022 (More) icon in a card's upper right corner and moving the cards to the top or the bottom of the list.\n \n \n \n!!! note \"Note\"\n The category tabs (section, separators) order can also be adjusted directly on {{ product_name }}'s Home screen: hover the mouse over an items category, e.g. Activity Timeline, then click the \u2022\u2022\u2022 (More) icon that appears on the right-hand side and then select either Move tab to Top or Move tab to Bottom\nYou can pin object type cards to keep their category tabs (sections, separators), including the Suggested New Records tab, constantly displayed in the Sidebar, even if {{ product_name }} cannot retrieve related items of that type from Salesforce.\nTo do that, find the item type's card in the central pane and toggle the \ud83d\udccc (Pin) icon the card's upper right corner.\n!!! tip \"Tip\"\n The set of cards recommended for pinning pin besides all Salesforce record types handled in your company: Activity Timeline, Tasks, Events, Emails. That ensures that their category tabs (sections, separators) are available even for a new Salesforce account that contains no such records\nFor example, if the Case card is not pinned and no Case related to selected email or calendar item is found in Salesforce, this object category will not be displayed in the Sidebar. \n \n \n8. Customizing Detailed Card View\nIn addition, via the page's central pane, you can define which record fields will be handled as Important. Important fields are listed for viewing and editing in an object's card, as well as in the Create new {record type} dialog and the Save email / Save event dialog.\nTo expand all Important fields of the object, click Show more record fields below the showed fields. To display all record fields, click the > (Expand) icon in a record card's header to open the detailed object card, where you also can view and edit all the fields.\n \n \n \n!!! warning \"Important\"\n Please note that a field is also handled as Important if it is set to be auto-prefilled with data (when viewed in the create a new record in Salesforce dialog)\nTo customize the detailed view, do the following:\n8.1. On the Customization page, click Detailed view for an object's card.\n \n \n \n8.2. Click the field you want to add to the card. You can use the Filter field to search for Salesforce fields that are not currently enabled in the Sidebar.\n \n \n \n >>> Click to view details \n \n 1. Save or Discard changes \n 2. Mark fields as Important , Force Required , or remove them from the list \n 3. Use Filter to find the necessary field \n 4. Click the + (add) button to add fields\n \n \n!!! note \"Note\"\n The order of fields placement on record cards cannot be adjusted in {{ short_name }} settings, as {{ product_name }} respects their order set in Salesforce; if you need to change it, make the corresponding updates in your Salesforce configuration\n8.3. Click on the \ud83d\udd89 (Edit) icon to adjust an object field's special parameters; there, you can mark the field as Important or Force Required. These parameters are only used by {{ short_name }} Add-In or Chrome Extension and have no ties in Salesforce of any kind.\nMarking Fields as Important\n \n \n \nImportant fields are prioritized for displaying when you create new records or view existing ones in the Sidebar. To display all fields, open the detailed object card or, if you are creating a new record, clear the Show only important fields checkbox.\n \n \nMark Fields as Force Required\nTo enhance fields filling flow via {{ short_name }}, after the Autumn 2021 update {{ product_name }} Customization includes a possibility to set specific fields of Salesforce objects processed or edited via {{ short_name }} Add-In as Force Required. That implies specified fields' filling becomes mandatory when a user creates or modifies an object that contains the field in the Sidebar.\nForce Required is located in the same field parameters as Important (see above).\n \n \n8.4.
