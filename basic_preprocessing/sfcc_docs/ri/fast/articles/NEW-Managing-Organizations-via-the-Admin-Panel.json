Before setting the this access type, you must obtain the [Exchange EWS URL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/exchange/client-developer/exchange-web-services/explore-the-ews-managed-api-ews-and-web-services-in-exchange) and a configured [Impersonating account](../Impersonation-O365/)'s login and password. See [this article](../Set-up-An-Impersonation-Service-Account/) for detailed steps how to configure everything for this access type.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n##### Microsoft 365 OAuth (EWS API) - End User logon\n\nThis option is used to authorize in {{ product_name }} end users with Office 365 mail accounts over Office 365 OAuth. See [this article](../Authorizing-Sync-Engine-to-Work-with-Your-Data/#activate_ri_sync_for_office_365) for more information. In the latest product updates it is the default option for bulk O365 users authorization [using a Service account](../Impersonation-O365/).\n\n&nbsp;\n\n##### Microsoft 365 OAuth (Graph API) - End User logon\n\nThis option is used to authorize in {{ product_name }} end users with Office 365 mail accounts over [MS Graph](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/overview). See [this article](../MS-Graph/) for more information. Also see [this article](../MS-Graph/#ms_graph_limitations) to learn about limitations presently associated with this connection type.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n##### Microsoft 365 OAuth (EWS API) - Impersonated logon\n\nThis option is used to mass-authorize in {{ product_name }} end users with Office 365 mail accounts via an [impersonating account](../Setting-Up-Impersonated-Access-and-Configuring-Mailbox-Access-for-Organizations-and-Users/). To use this access type, you must have mail server and {{ product_name }} Admin account credentials. See [this article](../Impersonation-O365/) for detailed steps how to configure everything for this access type.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n##### Microsoft 365 OAuth (Graph API) - App-only access logon\n\nThis option is used to mass-authorize in {{ product_name }} end users with Office 365 mail accounts via app-only access with MS Graph API. To use this access type, you must have mail server and {{ product_name }} Admin account credentials. See [this article](../Impersonation-Graph/) for detailed steps how to configure everything for this access type. Also see [this article](../MS-Graph/#ms_graph_limitations) to learn about limitations presently associated with this connection type.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n##### **Google Direct Logon**\n\nThis option is used to authorize in {{ product_name }} end users with Gmail / Google Workspace accounts over Gmail OAuth. The users will need to authorize it individually. See [this article](../How-to-Set-Up-the-Chrome-Extension-for-Salesforce-and-Gmail/) for more information.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n##### **Google Service Account**\n\nThis option is used to [mass-authorize in {{ product_name }}](../Gmail-Users-Mass-Provisioning/) end users with Gmail / Google Workspace accounts. See [this article](../Gmail-Service-Account/) for more information.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n##### {{ company_name }} Compatibility\n\nPresently, due to data access authorization specifics, only connection types *MS Exchange Direct Logon*, *Office 365 OAuth*, *Google Service Account* (partial), and *Google Direct Logon* are supported by the [full {{ company_name }} solution](https://docs.revenuegrid.com/). Via a custom workaround {{ company_name }} is also compatible with MS Graph; in this scenario, {{ company_name }} is configured to run over EWS tokens and {{ company_name }} works over MS Graph.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n* * *\n\n&nbsp;\n\n#### **Deleting Organizations**\n\nPlease note that you can delete an Organization only if it has no users with initialized [Exchange Storage](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/exchange/plan-and-deploy/deployment-ref/storage-configuration?view=exchserver-2019). If at least one user is initialized, you must delete the user first, and then the Organization. After you delete an Organization, all users that belong to it will be irrecoverably deleted.  \nAlso note that you cannot delete a default Organization.\n\nTo delete an existing organization:  \n\n**1\\.** Go to the **Organizations** tab\n\n**2\\.** From the list of organizations, select the organization you want to delete, and then click the **Delete** icon\n\n<p><img src=\"../../assets/images/d33v4339jhl8k0cloudfrontnet/docs/assets/57398d2e903360669faf1f0a/images/5b1f8f9f0428632c466ac80e.png\" class=\"minimized\">\n</p>\n\n&nbsp;\n**3\\.** In the confirmation message that appears, click **Delete**\n\n![](../assets/images/d33v4339jhl8k0cloudfrontnet/docs/assets/57398d2e903360669faf1f0a/images/5b30f01c0428632c466b4a53.png)\n\n\n&#160;\n &#160;\n\n",

Before setting the this access type, you must obtain the Exchange EWS URL and a configured Impersonating account's login and password. See this article for detailed steps how to configure everything for this access type.\nMicrosoft 365 OAuth (EWS API) - End User logon\nThis option is used to authorize in {{ product_name }} end users with Office 365 mail accounts over Office 365 OAuth. See this article for more information. In the latest product updates it is the default option for bulk O365 users authorization using a Service account.\nMicrosoft 365 OAuth (Graph API) - End User logon\nThis option is used to authorize in {{ product_name }} end users with Office 365 mail accounts over MS Graph. See this article for more information. Also see this article to learn about limitations presently associated with this connection type.\nMicrosoft 365 OAuth (EWS API) - Impersonated logon\nThis option is used to mass-authorize in {{ product_name }} end users with Office 365 mail accounts via an impersonating account. To use this access type, you must have mail server and {{ product_name }} Admin account credentials. See this article for detailed steps how to configure everything for this access type.\nMicrosoft 365 OAuth (Graph API) - App-only access logon\nThis option is used to mass-authorize in {{ product_name }} end users with Office 365 mail accounts via app-only access with MS Graph API. To use this access type, you must have mail server and {{ product_name }} Admin account credentials. See this article for detailed steps how to configure everything for this access type. Also see this article to learn about limitations presently associated with this connection type.\nGoogle Direct Logon\nThis option is used to authorize in {{ product_name }} end users with Gmail / Google Workspace accounts over Gmail OAuth. The users will need to authorize it individually. See this article for more information.\nGoogle Service Account\nThis option is used to mass-authorize in {{ product_name }} end users with Gmail / Google Workspace accounts. See this article for more information.\n{{ company_name }} Compatibility\nPresently, due to data access authorization specifics, only connection types MS Exchange Direct Logon, Office 365 OAuth, Google Service Account (partial), and Google Direct Logon are supported by the full {{ company_name }} solution. Via a custom workaround {{ company_name }} is also compatible with MS Graph; in this scenario, {{ company_name }} is configured to run over EWS tokens and {{ company_name }} works over MS Graph.\nDeleting Organizations\nPlease note that you can delete an Organization only if it has no users with initialized Exchange Storage. If at least one user is initialized, you must delete the user first, and then the Organization. After you delete an Organization, all users that belong to it will be irrecoverably deleted.\nAlso note that you cannot delete a default Organization.\nTo delete an existing organization: \n1. Go to the Organizations tab\n2. From the list of organizations, select the organization you want to delete, and then click the Delete icon\n \n \n3. In the confirmation message that appears, click Delete\n&#160;\n &#160;"
