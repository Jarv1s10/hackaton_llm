If your Org is using [EmailMessages](https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=emailadmin_enhanced_email_considerations.htm&type=5) instead (Enhanced Email feature enabled), this object type can be linked to a reasonable number of [People and Business records](http://www.sfdcpoint.com/salesforce/difference-between-whoid-and-whatid/), both via the *Related To* field. If a Lead is linked to an email, no other People or Business records can be linked\n- An [Event](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.sfFieldRef.meta/sfFieldRef/salesforce_field_reference_Event.htm) can be linked to several [Business records](http://www.sfdcpoint.com/salesforce/difference-between-whoid-and-whatid/) via the *Related To* field and to a reasonable number of [People records](http://www.sfdcpoint.com/salesforce/difference-between-whoid-and-whatid/) via the *Name* field. For internal (in-org) meeting attendees, Salesforce creates copies of Event objects.\n- All saved Activities (emails and calendar items) except ones linked to a Lead **must** be linked to an Account. This mandatory pattern is based on a Salesforce requirement, see Salesforce Help [article](https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=000336268&type=1&mode=1) for more information\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n* * *\n\n&nbsp;\n\n## Emails linking patterns\n\n{{ product_name }} can save [MS Outlook](../Saving-Emails-in-Salesforce-1.-Function-Overview/) and [Gmail emails](../Using-the-Solution-for-Salesforce-and-Gmail/#saving_emails_in_salesforce) as completed [Salesforce Tasks](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.sfFieldRef.meta/sfFieldRef/salesforce_field_reference_Task.htm) or as [EmailMessages](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.sfFieldRef.meta/sfFieldRef/salesforce_field_reference_EmailMessage.htm) (if [Enhanced Email](https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=emailadmin_enhanced_email_considerations.htm&type=5) is enabled in your Org).\n\nNote that if [Allow creating duplicated emails in Salesforce](../Item-Deduplication-Mechanisms/#allow_creating_email_duplicates_in_salesforce) is enabled in [{{ product_name }} Customization settings](../Customization-Settings-Explained/), you can get the resulting Task or EmailMessage linked to any reasonable number of [People and Business records](https://www.sfdcpoint.com/salesforce/difference-between-whoid-and-whatid/), by allowing {{ product_name }} to create several duplicates of it in Salesforce; each of these duplicates will be linked to a specific record, thus working around the limiting rules.\n\n\n\n### Saved as Tasks\n\n!!! tip \"Tip\"\n    Also see the cases described in [this article](../Save-Email-Dialog/#special_considerations_what_combinations_of_records_can_be_linked_to_saved_emails)\n\n&nbsp;\n\nA Salesforce Task based on a saved MS Outlook or Gmail email can be linked to a reasonable number of [People records](https://www.sfdcpoint.com/salesforce/difference-between-whoid-and-whatid/) and [Business records](https://www.sfdcpoint.com/salesforce/difference-between-whoid-and-whatid/).\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n#### Quick-saved as Tasks\n\nIf you use the **Quick save** icon located in a record card's header in the [Sidebar](../Introduction/) to save an email as a Salesforce Task ([Enhanced Email](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.emailadmin_enhanced_email_considerations.htm&type=5) not enabled), the resulting Task will be linked to this record only.\n\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n### Saved as EmailMessages\n\n!!!

note \"Note\"\n    {{ product_name }} also offers a unique optional possibility to link multiple [Business Records](https://www.sfdcpoint.com/salesforce/difference-between-whoid-and-whatid/) to Events saved in Salesforce [via {{ short_name }} Sync](../Synchronization-Engine-An-Overview/); this function is not available in Salesforce out-of-the-box.   \n    This feature requires [{{ company_name }} Salesforce managed package installation](../Admin-Managed-Package/) and can be enabled for our  customers upon request\n\n&nbsp;\n\n#### In-org attendees\n\nFor all in-org (internal) meeting attendees Salesforce creates copies of the [Event object](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.api.meta/api/sforce_api_objects_event.htm?search_text=event) synced via {{ product_name }}, as child Events under the organizer's parent Event.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n## Linking on [Auto-Saving](../Autosaving-Patterns/#events_auto-saving) or Saving via Category/Folder\n\nAlso see the general related records retrieval pattern described in [this article](../Initial-Search-and-Applied-Record-Filters/#the_resulting_related_records_list_will_include).\n\n&nbsp;\n\n* * *\n\n&nbsp;\n\n## Linking via the Save dialog\n\nWhen saving an email or calendar item via the Save button in [{{ product_name }}](../Introduction/), you can select [People and Business records](http://www.sfdcpoint.com/salesforce/difference-between-whoid-and-whatid/) to be linked to it in Salesforce in the Save email/Save event dialog.
