The Extension can be [installed individually](../How-to-Set-Up-the-Chrome-Extension-for-Salesforce-and-Gmail/) or mass-deployed for all end users by the local mail server Admin.\n\nThis article describes the mass deployment scenario where the local mail server Admin installs the [{{ short_name }} for Gmail and Salesforce Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/smartcloud-connect-for-sa/agfekjndkedoakoeahndfnjilkifbicn?hl=en) for all {{ short_name }} end users in an Org. It is a standard secure [Chrome browser extension](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions) reviewed by Google, and in the enterprise environment it can be mass-deployed for multiple end users using [Microsoft Group Policy](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/desktop/policy/group-policy-architecture) mechanisms. This Chrome Extension mass deployment method is only viable in Windows systems, [Windows Active Directory](https://searchwindowsserver.techtarget.com/definition/Active-Directory) environment.\n\nThe alternative method for non-Windows systems uses Google's native mechanisms which ensure automatic Extensions installation in Chrome browser after that was enforced for logged in Google accounts by Google Workplace Admin. See [this Google article](https://support.google.com/chrome/a/answer/6306504?hl=en) for complete information.\n\nBesides Extension installation, mass {{ product_name }} for Gmail deployment requires mass Sync activation via a Service account. See [this article](../Gmail-Service-Account/) to learn how to do that.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nTo mass-deploy the Chrome Extension using Active Directory, follow the instruction below (based on the [guidelines](https://dennisspan.com/deploying-google-chrome-extensions-using-group-policy/) developed by [Dennis Span](https://dennisspan.com/)).\n\n{{ product_name }} Extension deployment string to be used ([fast prod build](../Using-the-Solution-for-Salesforce-and-Gmail/) installation):   ````agfekjndkedoakoeahndfnjilkifbicn;https://clients2.google.com/service/update2/crx````\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**1\\.** Import the [Google Chrome ADMX files](https://support.google.com/chrome/a/answer/187202?hl=en) into your [Active Directory environment](https://searchwindowsserver.techtarget.com/definition/Active-Directory) \n\nThe described method to mass-deploy Chrome extensions is through [Microsoft Group Policy](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/desktop/policy/group-policy-architecture). As per [Google](http://www.chromium.org/administrators/frequently-asked-questions): \"*For Windows, it is recommended to use Group Policy vs. preferences  files because only Group Policy can be enforced*\".

For {{ short_name }} Extension mass deployment, we recommend you to use the [ADMX files](https://cloud.google.com/chrome-enterprise/browser/download/) only and not the ADM files. Before you can use Microsoft Group Policies to mass-deploy the Extension, you first need to import the Google Chrome ADMX files in your [Group Policy Central Store](https://activedirectorypro.com/configure-group-policy-central-store/).\nThe ADMX files, as well as the ADM language files, (**.ADML*) can be found in the directory *Configuration\\admx* of the extracted [Chrome Enterprise Bundle](https://cloud.google.com/chrome-enterprise/browser/download/) archive.\n\nIf you are not familiar with the Central Store for Group Policies and require more detailed information, refer to the official Microsoft article [How to create and manage the Central Store for Group Policy Administrative Templates in Windows](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/3087759/how-to-create-and-manage-the-central-store-for-group-policy-administra).\n\nChrome Enterprise Bundle includes the following six ADMX files:\n\n- *chrome.admx*\n- *ChromeUASwitcher.admx*\n- *google.admx*\n- *GoogleUpdate.admx*\n- *LegacyBrowserSupport.admx*\n- *PasswordAlert.admx*\n\nThe purposes of most of these ADMX files are self-explanatory, except for the ADMX file *google.admx*. This file only has one purpose, which is to set the shared *\u201cGoogle\u201d* folder in the [Group Policy editor](https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/79976-open-local-group-policy-editor-windows-10-a.html). This folder ensures that all Google policy settings (for the Chrome browser or other Google products) are grouped under one folder.\n\n![](https://dennisspan.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Deep-dive-automating-and-configuring-Google-Chrome-Google-Chrome-group-policies.jpg)\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe Group Policy Central Store is located on your [domain controllers](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/4193/domain-controller-dc).  \n&nbsp;\n\n- The Central Store root path (containing the ADMX files):\n  _\\\\\\%LogonServer%\\sysvol\\\\**#DomainName#**\\Policies\\PolicyDefinitions_\n\n![](https://dennisspan.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Deep-dive-automating-and-configuring-Google-Chrome-Group-Policy-Central-Store.jpg)\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe ADMX files are put in the root of the Store; the language files (**.ADML*), are put in the language-specific subdirectories.\n\n- Central Store subdirectories for the language files:\n  _\\\\\\%LogonServer%\\sysvol\\\\**#DomainName#**\\Policies\\PolicyDefinitions\\\\**#languagecode-countrycode#**_\n\nCopy the Chrome ADMX files into this folder:\n\n![](https://dennisspan.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Deep-dive-automating-and-configuring-Google-Chrome-Group-Policy-Central-Store-ADMX-files.jpg)\n\n&nbsp;\n\nCopy the English language *.ADML* files into the en-US folder:\n\n![](https://dennisspan.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Deep-dive-automating-and-configuring-Google-Chrome-Group-Policy-Central-Store-ADML-files.jpg)\n\n&nbsp;\n\n!!! note \"Note\"\n    The 2021 updates of {{ product_name }} also include support for several more languages; make sure to copy non-English ADML files for the supported language(s) you will use into their corresponding directories.

The local repository of a Windows server is located here: *C:\\Windows\\PolicyDefinitions*. Apply the same procedure for copying the ADMX and ADML files as for the Central Store. Use the local Group Policy editor to configure your settings (*gpedit.msc*).\n\n!!! warning \"Important\"\n    The future versions of Chrome will feature updated .ADMX and .ADML files included into [Chrome Enterprise Bundle](https://cloud.google.com/chrome-enterprise/browser/download/). Please remember that your Group Policy settings are **not** affected when you update the .ADMX files.
