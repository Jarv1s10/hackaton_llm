This add-in could not be started. Close this dialog to ignore the problem or click \"Restart\" to try again*\", that might be caused an issue with [{{ product_name }}](../Introduction/) rendering. This article describes the ways to resolve the issue. The solutions are only applicable for MS Outlook Desktop for Windows. \n\n![](../assets/images/Using-SmartCloud-Connect/How-To-s/Troubleshooting/add-in-error.png)\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n### Solution 1: Refresh Microsoft Browser Configuration\n\nThe error may occur with various Add-Ins / plugins installed in MS Outlook Desktop for Windows. The below guidelines are official ones provided by Microsoft.  \n\nThe first step is to determine the versions of Windows OS and MS Outlook that you are using. These versions define  which native Microsoft browser is used to render MS Outlook Add-Ins; that might be MS Edge or MS Internet Explorer.\n\nSee [this Microsoft article](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office/dev/add-ins/concepts/browsers-used-by-office-web-add-ins) to find out which one is used in your system based on your Windows version and Office package version combination. Users running the latest Windows 10 and Microsoft 365 Office updates typically have their Add-Ins rendered by MS Edge.\n\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n#### If your system uses MS Edge\n\nSometimes the error is caused by [MS Desktop App Web Viewer](https://appsource.microsoft.com/en-us/product/office/WA104295828?tab=Overview) getting corrupt. Take the steps below to re-install this module.  \n\n**1\\.** Close all MS Office apps running in your system, including MS Outlook  \n**2\\.** Run the following cmdlet in Windows PowerShell or command line on your PC, with Admin permissions:  \n\n```\npowershell Add-AppxPackage -register -disable {Windows folder on system disk path e.g. 'C:\\Windows\\'}\\SystemApps\\Microsoft.Win32WebViewHost_cw5n1h2txyewy\\AppxManifest.xml\n```\n\n**3\\.** Run MS Outlook and try [opening {{ short_name }} Add-In](../How-to-Install-and-Run-the-Solution-all-configurations/#1_open_the_sidebar) to see if the issue was resolved  \n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n#### If none of Microsoft Add-Ins work or Sidebar controls become unclickable (WebView2 runtime)\n\nThe issue where important [Sidebar elements](../Introduction/) become unclickable, e.g. the *Save* or *Create* button, has a technical cause on Microsoft Outlook side. Specifically, due to the ongoing Microsoft transition from old MS Edge to [Chromium MS Edge](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/download-the-new-microsoft-edge-based-on-chromium-0f4a3dd7-55df-60f5-739f-00010dba52cf) some MS Outlook for Windows versions have an interface frames rendering issue with MS Edge. Microsoft is planning to roll out a complete solution in a [future MS Windows update](https://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2020/10/19/edge-webview2-general-availability/).\n\nAn official workaround [provided by Microsoft](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/office/blogs/office-add-ins-community-call-february-10-2021/):  \n\n!!! note \"Note\"\n    The workaround works only for Windows 10 and Office 365 or Microsoft 365 package version *16.0.13530.20424* or newer.
