Created Leads'/Contacts' fields will be populated with data retrieved from the meeting invitation's/email's signature, if one is available.  \n\nThe Calendar Event or Task/EmailMessage object created in Salesforce to [match](../Object-Fields-Mapping-Patterns/) the saved item will be linked to this Lead or Contact. Note that {{ short_name }} will be lacking certain details to populate some of auto-created Leads' or Contacts' key fields, so the users should [populate these fields later](../All-User-Actions-in-Add-In-Sidebar/#5_improved_records_browsing_and_updating) via the [Sidebar](../Introduction/) to make them more detailed.  \n\nTo request enabling of the Auto-resolving feature for your org, send a corresponding request to [{{ company_name }} support team](mailto:support@revenuegrid.com), specifying if you would prefer Leads or Contacts to be auto-created for unresolved meeting attendees' addresses. Optionally, {{ product_name }} can also create [Person Accounts](https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=account_person.htm&type=5) instead of Leads/Contacts.\n\n!!! note \"Note\"\n    Email addresses and domains blocklisted from syncing will **not** be processed on Leads/Contacts auto-resolving (auto-creating) by {{ short_name }} for this user. The blocklist is managed on [two levels](../Two-Layers-Blacklisting/): email addresses and domains can be blocklisted [by an individual {{ short_name }} user](../Configuring-Activities-Synchronization-Settings/#blocklisting_email_addresses_and_domains) and [by the Org Admin](../Special-Admin-Panel-Settings/#emails_domains_blocklisted_from_sync) (e.g. internal domains). Also, a special global setting blocklists all free email services (e.g. *gmail.com*, *yahoo.com*, etc.) from auto-syncing by default. To change or customize this setting, contact our [support team](mailto:support@revenuegrid.com)\n\n&nbsp;\n\nFinally, the latest {{ short_name }} updates include optional advanced smart Lead/Contact auto-resolving mechanisms. See the descriptions of the settings *SalesforceSmartCreateUnresolvedObjects* and *SalesforceEmailCreateAllUnresolvedRecipients* in [this article](../Special-Admin-Panel-Settings/#extra_configuration_settings) to learn more about these mechanisms.  \n\nIn addition, {{ short_name }} can optionally auto-create new Accounts to link the auto-created Contacts to in case there is no relevant Account retrieved by [{{ short_name }} Initial Search](../Initial-Search-and-Applied-Record-Filters/). The auto-created Account's *Name* field will be based on the corporate email domain from the attendee's email address. Later the Account's specific details can be [populated by the user](../All-User-Actions-in-Add-In-Sidebar/#5_improved_records_creation_updating_browsing) via the [Sidebar](../Introduction/).\n\nAlternatively, all auto-resolved Contacts can be linked to a specific Account [pre-defined by the local Admin](../Special-Admin-Panel-Settings/#extra_configuration_settings) or [{{ company_name }} support team](mailto:support@revenuegrid.com). Later, such Contacts can be sorted and re-linked to proper Accounts individually by someone in the Org.  \n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n* * *\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n#### Instant Sync of Calendar Items\n\n!!! note \"Note\"\n    To enable the instant sync, send a corresponding request to [our CSM team](mailto:support@revenuegrid.com)\n\n&nbsp;\n\n##### MS Outlook Calendar \u279d Salesforce Calendar instant sync  \n\nInstant synchronization (*instant sync*) is available for MS Outlook Meetings, Appointments, and All-Day Events; it enables {{ short_name }} end users to synchronize their calendars with Salesforce calendar in real time within 5 minutes.  \n\nInstant sync only triggers when a calendar item is created, updated, or deleted in MS Outlook; it does **not** trigger on any event updates in Salesforce calendar. Its behavior can be adjusted in [{{ short_name }} Global Settings](../Special-Admin-Panel-Settings/#extra_configuration_settings) (which are usually managed by [RevenueGrid.com CSM team](mailto:support@revenuegrid.com)). Instant sync can also be set to trigger specifically on calendar items creation, calendar items updating, or calendar items deletion.  \n\nWhen activated by a meeting change in MS Exchange / Office 365, Instant sync auto-triggers [Force synchronization](../How-to-Open-Sync-Dashboard-(Adaptive-view)/#force_scc_sync), this way initiating a sync session ahead of the default 30 minute sync interval; several sequential instant syncs can be performed only with 1-3 minute intervals, not immediately.  \n\nEvents instant sync from mailbox to Salesforce is **not** available for [{{ product_name }} Chrome Extension for Gmail](../Using-the-Solution-for-Salesforce-and-Gmail/) and MS Graph users.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n##### Salesforce Calendar \u279d Email client Calendar  instant sync\n\nInstant calendar Events down-syncing from Salesforce to email client should be [additionally configured](../instant-sync/) after [{{ company_name }} managed package](../Admin-Managed-Package/) is installed in an Org.
