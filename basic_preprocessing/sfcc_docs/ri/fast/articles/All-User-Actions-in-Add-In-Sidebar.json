In addition, you can open a related record included in the header instantly by clicking on its name.\n\nNote that the fields included into record headers are not shown in their expanded cards (but are shown in detailed record view).

It is used on records field values editing via the Sidebar's [Detailed card view](../All-User-Actions-in-Add-In-Sidebar/#4_viewing_the_details_instantly).  \n\nSometimes {{ short_name }} users want to make updates to several fields before they apply all the changes to the record in Salesforce. To achieve that, they should click the button **Continue editing** instead of Save after editing individual fields:\n\n<p><img src=\"..\\..\\assets\\images\\Using-SmartCloud-Connect\\continue-editing2.png\" style=\"width: 50%; height: 50%;\">\n</p>\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAfter that, proceed to editing other fields. Note the **\u2b6f** (Revert) icon that appears next to fields which were updated; clicking on it allows to quickly recover the original field value. After the values have been finalized, click on the button **Save changes for this {record type}** in the Detailed view to apply the changes:\n\n\n<details><summary> >>> Click to see a screenshot <<< </summary>\n<p><img src=\"..\\..\\assets\\images\\Using-SmartCloud-Connect\\continue-editing1.png\" style=\"width: 50%; height: 50%;\">\n</p></details>\n&nbsp;\n\nClicking Save in an individual field editing dialog also applies all changes you have made\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n",
