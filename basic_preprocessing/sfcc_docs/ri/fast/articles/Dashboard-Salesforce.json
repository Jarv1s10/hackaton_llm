Sales management widgets normally include detailed Salesforce information on Lead, Contact, or Opportunity engagement status, sales reports, conversion/win rate, average deal size, revenue, etc. A Sales management widget allows Sales Managers to monitor the performance of their sales teams with the help of accurate metrics. What is more, sales widgets can help sales reps analyze their progress and see what else they should do to meet their quota.\n\nThere are several types of sales widgets: sales representative widgets, sales manager widgets, deal performance widgets, and more.\n\n{{ company_name }}\u2019s Sales Widgets allow you to instantly view how well your team is engaging with important deals or Opportunities that need a fast reply, and make sure you act right on opportunities with no planned activities or old Opportunities with no recent activities.\n\nThe configurable widgets offered by {{ company_name }} are based on [Salesforce native Canvas App technology](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.platform_connect.meta/platform_connect/canvas_framework_intro.htm).

Omitting either one of these prerequisites will result in errors. See [this article](../Dashboard-Troubleshooting/) for information on troubleshooting different widgets configuration errors.\n\n!!! note \"Note\"\n    All configuration actions are performed via a [local Salesforce Admin account](https://www.salesforce.com/blog/what-is-a-salesforce-admin/).

In the request, make sure to specify what widgets are going to use: {{ product_name }} ones and/or {{ company_name }} ones. This way you'll get the *ServerSyncTenantUrl* and *RevenueGridTenantUrl* parameters required for the setup. Alternatively, you can generate the tenant URLs following the step-by-step instruction in [this article](../How-to-generate-tenant-urls/) \n\n\n\n**1\\.2.** Next, you should enable *My domain* for your Salesforce Org, as described in [this article](../Dashboard-Prerequisites/)  \n\n\n\n**1\\.3.** Install {{ company_name }} managed package for your Org.
