It solely transfers relevant data between your email server and your Salesforce over secure MS Azure protocols via TLS 1.2 encrypted protocol in-transit and at rest. The product's interactions with your Salesforce are authorized via the native OAuth method. Similarly, mail server interactions are authorized via supported secure mechanisms like O365 / Exchange OAuth or Google OAuth. Thus, no user login credentials are stored by {{ short_name }} either.  \nOnly the following data types get temporarily stored in {{ short_name }} Azure infrastructure:  \n\n- {{ short_name }} user full name and email address for authentication purposes\n- Key diagnostics details: non-personal data, such as: email or meeting identifiers in the system, *Sent* and *Received* dates, along with user setting configurations. These are needed solely for customer support and troubleshooting purposes. The logs get encrypted for secure transferring and keeping, they can only be accessed by entitled Support specialists to investigate issues. All diagnostics data gets automatically purged from the system 90 days after collection\n- Starting with the May 2022 update, we also introduce an advanced logging mode that can be enabled for complex troubleshooting cases upon a customer's request.
