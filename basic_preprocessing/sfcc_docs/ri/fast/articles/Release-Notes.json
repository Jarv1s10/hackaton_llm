With this setting enabled, all the buttons and links leading to Customization and Sync Settings pages are hidden from the Add-In's interface, and the users cannot access them and change any Book Me/ Time Slots and other objects' defaults, etc. \n\nTo request the enabling of this on-demand feature for your organization, contact [{{ company_name }} support team by email](mailto:support@revenuegrid.com)\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n#### 2209 Bugfixes\n\n**1\\.** Time Slots booking page fix in MS Outlook 2013: ensured that empty slots are displayed as designed\n\n**2\\.** Addressed the cause of an issue where the expected time of the next sync session was calculated with 1-minute inaccuracy.

Now that includes all [components of the Add-In and the Sync Engine](../AddIn-vs-Sync-Functions/)  \n- [{{ company_name }} revenue intelligence platform](https://docs.revenuegrid.com/) got rebranded to *Revenue Engage*  \n- Invisible.io got rebranded to *RevenueGrid.com*  \n\nProduct users are not affected by the rebranding in any way, it's the same use conditions, the same set of functions, plus an updated interface and extra features.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**2\\.** {{ product_name }} [Sidebar user interface](../Introduction/) got tweaked, the following controls were slightly moved or changed for increased usability\n\n- The key controls layout in the header was updated as follows. This results in a better compatibility with mobile devices\n\n![](../assets/images/Using-SmartCloud-Connect/new_header.png)\n&nbsp;\n\n- Navigation was improved by adding Sidebar screen/card names and moving the navigation controls to the top of the Sidebar\n![](../assets/images/Using-SmartCloud-Connect/navigate.png)\n&nbsp;\n-  Similarly, the **Cancel** and **Save/Create** buttons and the **Show only important fields** checkbox previously put at the bottom of various dialogs have been relocated to the Sidebar's header\n![](../assets/images/Using-SmartCloud-Connect/buttons_header.png)\n\n&nbsp;\n\n-   The **Menu** icon was moved to the left-hand side of the header and the Menu is now implemented as a dedicated screen instead of a dialog, so it's easy to use on mobile devices\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**3\\.** Released an advanced Salesforce managed package that ensures maximum {{ product_name }} integration with Salesforce. The package also includes essential visual components elements (Salesforce Canvas panes), for the best use experience it should be installed for all {{ short_name }} users in an Org by the local Salesforce Admin, along with the older [Invisible Suite package](../Admin-Managed-Package/). More information [here](../Admin-Managed-Package/).\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**4\\.** Implemented several new convenient {{ short_name }} customization settings: *Notify when email is opened*, *Hide Chatter*, *Do not allow attaching .EML files to objects*, *Do not allow to work with email templates*, *Do not allow to search objects in LinkedIn*, *Support Case Assignment Rules*, *Support Lead Assignment Rules*, *Edit email body in Save dialog*.

What fields can be extracted  based on a signature: \n  *First/Last name  \n  Address  \n  Title  \n  Email  \n  Phones (if multiple - assign according to Contact's phone fields)  \n  Account*  \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**7\\.** [User-initiated records search](../Searching-for-Existing-Salesforce-Records-and-Creating-New-Records-(Adaptive-view)/) via [{{ product_name }}](../Introduction/) got improved: now when viewing search results the users also see secondary record fields besides the Name field; this helps to identify different records with identical names.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**8\\.** [Revenue Engage integration] Implemented a setting *RevenueGridConfiguration* that allows to enable or disable [Revenue Engage](https://docs.revenuegrid.com/) access controls in [{{ product_name }}](../Introduction/).\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**9\\.** Implemented an optional \"Edit email on saving\" feature available for big Enterprise {{ short_name }} customers which is managed via Customization settings.

Also note that the color-marking way to sync Gmail calendar event is now disabled by default and it can be enabled by request.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n##### Engagement tracking panel improvements\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**1\\.** Added displaying of minutes in Engagement tracking details to allow the users to know specific time when the email was opened by a recipient. Also changed the label and the font of notifications counter.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**2\\.** Engagement tracking panel improvement: now it is possible to reset the new engagement notifications counter by *Ctrl* pressing  + double-clicking the Engagement tracking icon in the Sidebar's bottom toolbar.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**3\\.** Another Engagement panel improvement: implemented an optional possibility to auto-pin (mark as important) in Engagement panel all external (not in-org) emails with auto-inserted tracking code. The new Customization setting used to manage that is \"Notify when email is opened\".\n\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n* * *\n\n&nbsp;\n\n#### Notable fixes\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**1\\.** Fixed an issue that occurred in configurations which use Person Accounts, resulting in a Sync issue \"Can not select a person account\".\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**2\\.** Fixed an issue with processing of user-defined \"Email domains blacklisted from syncing\" values involving aliases (with [+] in the address). Now they are handled as designed.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**3\\.** Fixed an issue where an incorrect set of objects was linked to a saved email or event after extra objects to link were added using search in the Saved email/Save event dialog. Now only specifically selected objects from search are linked.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**4\\.** Fixed an issue that prevented {{ short_company_name }} Sidebar logon with Salesforce creds for some of end users (the \"SimpleWebClient concurrent use\" exception).\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**5\\.** Fixed an issue where some labels and messages in various {{ product_name }} components remained in English after switching to another localization. Now they are translated.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**6\\.** Fixed an issue where the bottom item in the related records search results list of the Save email/Save event dialog was sometimes not displayed.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**7\\.** Fixed a specific issue where the latest clicked Opportunity was  displayed in the \"Related to\" field of the clones for emails after  saving the email link to various objects.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**8\\.** Fixed an issue where Salesforce all-day events were synchronized as 5pm - 5pm events in Gmail calendar. Now they are synced as proper Gmail all-day events.\n\n\n\n\n\n***The update also included a number of other less significant bugfixes, back end and front end performance optimizations, minor UX/UI tweaks, etc.***\n\n&nbsp;\n\n* * *\n\n&nbsp;\n\n### 2002 Hotfix 1 Release Notes\n\n&nbsp;\n\n#### Improvements and new features\n\n**1\\.** Due to development of a [new products line](https://docs.revenuegrid.com/) and marketing focus expansion\n\n- Solution gets rebranded to *{{ company_name }}*  \n- Invisible.io gets rebranded to *RevenueGrid.com*  \n\nProduct users are not affected by the rebranding in any way, it's the same use conditions, the same set of functions, plus a slightly updated interface and extra features.\n\n**2\\.** We added a related records selection mechanism implemented as checkboxes to the [Save Email/Save Event dialog](../Save-Email-Dialog/); it works in the same manner as the checkboxes removed from the [Sidebar](../Introduction/)'s home screen.\n\n![](../assets/images/Using-SmartCloud-Connect/How-To-s/Saving-Emails-in-Salesforce-2.-Ways-to-Save-an-Email-(Adaptive-view)/dialog_checkboxes.png)\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**3\\.** Implemented an additional [Customization setting](../Customization-Settings-Explained/#2_application_settings) that regulates [Engagement notifications](../How-to-Use-SCC-Engagement-Panel-%28Adaptive-view%29/#to_view_collected_tracking_information_in_the_engagement_panel) displaying for emails to external (not in-org) contacts  with auto-inserted tracking code; the setting is called \"Notify when email is opened\". When it is enabled, notifications in SCC Sidebar's  bottom toolbar will be displayed when the tracking code is triggered by the recipients of all such emails, as if they were marked as Important in the Engagement panel by the user.\n\n**4\\.** Improved wording in several [Save Email/Save Event dialogs'](../Save-Email-Dialog/) fields labels.\n\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&#160;\n\n",
