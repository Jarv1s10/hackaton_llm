The cache is certain information downloaded by your browser intended to improve the browser loading performance, but sometimes the outdated cached data can lead to website loading issues.\n<br><br>\n\nTo troubleshoot the browser cache issue, try to clear your browser cache and perform the login procedure to {{ short_name }} Add-in again.\n\nRefer to the following articles on clearing the cache in [Google Chrome](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/32050?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop), [Firefox](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/how-clear-firefox-cache), [Microsoft Edge](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/view-and-delete-browser-history-in-microsoft-edge-00cf7943-a9e1-975a-a33d-ac10ce454ca4), and [Safari](https://support.apple.com/guide/safari/manage-cookies-sfri11471/mac).\n\n&nbsp;\n\n***\n\n&nbsp;\n\n## Browser settings issue\n\nIf the troubleshooting steps described above have not resolved the Add-In login redirect page loading issue, the reason can be related to the browser settings. To verify that the problem is in the current browser, copy the Add-in login redirect page URL and try to open it in a different browser. If the Add-in login page loads successfully in a different browser, it confirms that the issue is related to the initial browser.\n<br><br>\n\nTo troubleshoot the browser settings issue, try to reset your browser settings to default and perform the login procedure to {{ short_name }} Add-in again.\n\nRefer to the following articles on returning the browser to default settings for [Google Chrome](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/3296214?hl=en), [Firefox](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/refresh-firefox-reset-add-ons-and-settings), [Microsoft Edge](https://malwaretips.com/blogs/reset-microsoft-edge/), and [Safari](https://malwaretips.com/blogs/how-to-reset-safari-to-default-settings-mac-guide/).",
