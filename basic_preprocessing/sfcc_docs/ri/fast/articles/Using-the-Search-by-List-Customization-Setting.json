This simplifies search value entry \u2013 instead of entering both name and surname into the search box (exact value search is used) you will need to enter only either one of them.\n*   Another common best-use practice (requires Salesforce admin permissions to set up): [create in Salesforce](http://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=adding_fields.htm&type=5) (if it did not exist in your customization) a custom _2nd Email_ field for your email correspondent record types that will store the interlocutor\u2019s secondary (personal) email address, then include the field in **Search by**.  \n    \n\tSecondary addresses are often used in communication besides the primary (business) ones and, since **Search by** also defines [{{ product_name }} initial search process](../Initial-Search-and-Applied-Record-Filters/), this will allow messages received from the secondary address to be properly processed and associated in Salesforce. This is the most convenient way to deal with messages incoming from secondary addresses, however, if creating in Salesforce and populating the _2nd Email_ field for new records is not an option for you, you can find the relevant objects using [{{ product_name }} search](../Searching-for-Existing-Salesforce-Records-and-Creating-New-Records-(Adaptive-view)/) and link them manually.\n  \n\n\n&#160;\n &#160;\n\n",
