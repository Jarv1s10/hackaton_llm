This limit can be adjusted by request sent to [our CSM team](mailto:support@revenuegrid.com). \n\n&nbsp;\n\n!!! tip \"Tip\"\n    Also, see [this {{ company_name }} blog article](https://revenuegrid.com/blog/how-to-schedule-a-meeting-by-email/) for special insights about scheduling meetings via emails\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe organizer's and required in-org invitees' availability spans are parsed on Book Me link generation, and later if a another slot gets occupied that is also reflected on the [Booking page](../Sharing-Calendar-Availability-%28Adaptive-view%29/#how_to_book_a_slot_recipient_side) viewed by the recipient.  \n\nAs soon as a recipient clicks on their preferred slot, {{ product_name }} checks if the slot is still available in the organizer's and required in-Org attendees' calendars. In case it was occupied by another booking, the recipient is suggested to pick another slot. In addition, by refreshing Booking page browser window, the recipient can actualize the availability table after such checks.      \n\n\n&nbsp;\n\nBook Me links can be generated by the Add-In even if [{{ short_name }} Sync Engine](../Synchronization-Engine-An-Overview/) is not running; however, in this case, if any slot is booked, the resulting meetings won't be synced in the Salesforce calendar till [syncing is resumed](../Handling-Sync-Issues/).\n\n&nbsp;\n    \n!!! tip \"Tip\"\n    See [this article](../Book-Me-Gmail/) to learn how to use the Book Me feature in [{{ short_name }} Chrome Extension](../Using-the-Solution-for-Salesforce-and-Gmail/)\n\n&nbsp;\n\n!!! tip \"Tip\"\n    Also, see [this {{ company_name }} blog article](https://revenuegrid.com/blog/how-to-schedule-a-meeting-by-email/) for special insights\n\n&nbsp;\n<!-- (video is outdated and describes only Quick Send Availability)\n<iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/392661575\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n-->\n\n&nbsp;\n\n* * *\n\n&nbsp;\n\n## To initiate a meeting by sharing your availability periods with business contacts\n\nUsing {{ product_name }}, you can generate a Book Me link after opening which, the recipient will be redirected to the Booking page, where they can select a time slot convenient for all parties and book a meeting. \n\nThe section below provides step-by-step instructions on Book Me link generation and a description of the main fields and controls in the Book Me dialog.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n### Open the Book Me dialog in {{ product_name }}\n\n<p>\n    <img src=\"..\\..\\assets\\images\\Using-SmartCloud-Connect\\How-To-s\\Sharing-Calendar-Availability-(Adaptive-view)\\rg-open-ribbon.png\" style=\"width:39.29%; display:inline-block; vertical-align:middle; margin-left:1px;float: right\">\n</p>\n\n**1\\.** Open the [Sidebar](../Introduction/) for a selected, opened or new email message in MS Outlook Desktop by clicking the **Open {{ company_name }}** button in the ribbon.  \nSee [this article](../Open-in-Outlook-Web/) to learn how to open the Sidebar in MS Outlook on the Web\n\n<br><br><br>\n\n<p>\n    <img src=\"..\\..\\assets\\images\\Using-SmartCloud-Connect\\How-To-s\\Sharing-Calendar-Availability-(Adaptive-view)\\open-bookme.png\" style=\"width:46.82%; display:inline-block; vertical-align:middle; margin-left:1px;float: right\">\n</p>\n\n**2\\.** In the Sidebar, click the **Book Me** icon in the **Smart Actions** bottom toolbar\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\nOnce you click the **Book Me** icon, you will see the following **Book Me** dialog in the Sidebar:\n\n<p>\n    <img src=\"..\\..\\assets\\images\\Using-SmartCloud-Connect\\How-To-s\\Sharing-Calendar-Availability-(Adaptive-view)\\bookme-full.png\">\n</p>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<details><summary> >>> Click to view details <<< </summary>\n    <p>\n        <b>1.</b> Action buttons <b>Cancel</b> and <b>Insert</b>:\n        <ul>\n            <li>Click <b>Cancel</b> to cancel the link creation and leave the Book Me dialog</li>\n            <li>Click <b>Insert</b> to generate the Book Me link after filling in all required fields</li>\n        </ul>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        <b>2.</b> The <b>subject</b> of the meeting. {{ short_name }} prefills it with the email subject, but you can modify it\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        <b>3.</b> The <b>location</b> where the meeting will hold (meeting room, online, etc.)\n    </p>\n    <p>\n        <b>4.</b> The available <b>duration</b> of slots for the meeting.

This limit can be adjusted by request sent to our CSM team. \n!!! tip \"Tip\"\n Also, see this {{ company_name }} blog article for special insights about scheduling meetings via emails\nThe organizer's and required in-org invitees' availability spans are parsed on Book Me link generation, and later if a another slot gets occupied that is also reflected on the Booking page viewed by the recipient. \nAs soon as a recipient clicks on their preferred slot, {{ product_name }} checks if the slot is still available in the organizer's and required in-Org attendees' calendars.
