This feature is controlled by serversync setting *SalesforceEventReadResourceLocation* which enables (\"1\") or disables (default value \"0\") special location handling for Events. This feature supports only one-way synchronization from MS Exchange to Salesforce. Therefore, all relevant changes in MS Exchange will be reflected in Salesforce after synchronization.\n\nProceed with the following steps to set up the sync of rooms from the MS Exchange calendar to the Salesforce calendar.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n### 1.
