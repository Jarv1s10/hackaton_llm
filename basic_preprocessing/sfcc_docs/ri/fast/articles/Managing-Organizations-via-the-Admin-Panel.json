To request the permissions for your organization, [contact {{ company_name }} support team by email](mailto:support@revenuegrid.com). Admin panel provides tools for managing end users and some of its key settings it includes duplicate {{ product_name }} [Customization](../Customization-Settings-Explained/) and [Sync](../Configuring-Activities-Synchronization-Settings/) settings on Admin level.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n## Managing Profiles in the new Admin Panel\n\nIn {{ product_name }} Administration Panel context, a Profile (previously, Organization) is a group of Users with shared basic settings which cooperate in a shared Salesforce space.\n\n<img src=\"..\\..\\assets\\images\\new-admin-panel\\profiles\\profiles.png\" style=\"width:40%; display:inline-block; vertical-align:middle; margin-left:10px; float: right\">\nThe **Profiles** tab of [Administration Panel](../How-to-Log-In-to-the-Admin-Panel/) provides mechanisms for defining synchronization configuration for a Profile. \n\n!!! note \"Note\"\n    In the current implementation there is no way to limit the access rights for Admin Users, so an assigned Admin User can manage users belonging to all Profiles locally \n\n&nbsp;\n\n#### **Profiles List View**\n\nOn the **Profiles** tab, you can see the following columns:  \n\n*   **ID** (this column is hidden by default)\n*   **Name**\n*   **Mailbox access type**\n*   **Synchronization status**\n*   **Actions**\n\nClick any column name and select to **sort ascending** or **sort descending**.\n\n<p><img src=\"..\\..\\assets\\images\\new-admin-panel\\profiles\\columns.png\" class=\"minimized\">\n</p>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n<img src=\"..\\..\\assets\\images\\new-admin-panel\\profiles\\filter.png\" style=\"width:40%; display:inline-block; vertical-align:middle; margin-left:10px; float: right\">\nIn the **Filter by** box, you can select what Profiles to display by their **Synchronization Status** and **Mailbox Access Type**.

If synchronization is [not set up](../Email-Integration-Full-Deployment-Scenarios/) or is [suspended](../Handling-Sync-Issues/) for the whole Organization \u2013 it is displayed in red font color.\n\nVia the **Profiles** tab you can perform the following tasks:  \n\n*   **Create Profiles**\n*   **View and edit Profiles' details**\n*   **Delete Profiles**  \n\n&nbsp;\n***\n&nbsp;\n\n#### **Creating Profiles**\n\nTo create a profile:  \n\n**1\\.** Go to the **Profiles** tab  \n\n<img src=\"..\\..\\assets\\images\\new-admin-panel\\profiles\\create-profile.png\" style=\"width:40%; display:inline-block; vertical-align:middle; margin-left:10px; float: right\">\n\n**2\\.** In the upper right corner of the page, click **Create Profile** in the upper right-hand corner of the interface\n\n**3\\.** Fill in the **Name** field  \n\n**4\\.** Fill in the **External Id** field (the value becomes read-only and cannot be changed later)  \n\n**5\\.** Click **Save** to complete Profile creation \n\n&nbsp;\n***\n&nbsp;\n\n#### **Editing Profiles**\n\nTo modify a Profile:\n\n**1\\.** Go to the **Profiles** tab  \n\n**2\\.** To edit or view a Profile, click on the necessary one on the list \n\n**3\\.** Switch to the **Details** subtab  \n\n**4\\.** Edit the necessary Profile parameters \n\n**5\\.** Click **Save**    \n\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\n### **Viewing Profile Subtabs**\n\nThere are the following subtabs on the **Profiles** tab which contain relevant sets of actions. \n\n!!! note \"Note\"\n    The columns on the subtabs can be added or removed via the columns actions picklist summoned by clicking the <img src=\"..\\..\\assets\\images\\new-admin-panel\\licenses\\tune-normal.svg\" style=\"display:inline-block; vertical-align:middle; margin:1px; object-fit:contain;\"> (**Menu**) icon\n\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\n#### **General** \u2013 the subtab for configuring general Profile settings\n\nThe General subtab contains settings that are common for all users belonging to this Profile. Users can change majority of these settings on their Sync Settings page, Sidebar Customization page. Once you change any settings on this page and save them, users won't be able to edit them on their Sync Settings page, Sidebar Customization page. However, you as an admin can change them anytime on this page.\n\n<img src=\"..\\..\\assets\\images\\new-admin-panel\\profiles\\detailed-info.png\" class=\"minimized\">\n</p>\n\n<br><br>\n\n##### Sync Settings\n\n<img src=\"..\\..\\assets\\images\\new-admin-panel\\profiles\\sync.png\" style=\"width:50%; display:inline-block; vertical-align:middle; margin-left:10px; float: right\" class=\"minimized\">\n\nSync section contains settings for fine-tuning and standardizing synchronization for users. These settings will apply to all users in the Profile and they won't be able to change them on their level.\n\nIn the **Sync** section, it is possible to push specific [synchronization settings](../Configuring-Activities-Synchronization-Settings/) to all users belonging to a Profile, or to groups of users and individual users within a Profile; the users can be allowed or disallowed to adjust these settings. If you need to preset individual sync settings to different users in the Profile, send us a corresponding request to [our Support team](mailto:support@revenuegrid.com).\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\n\n**Auto-saving of emails**\n\nWith this setting enabled users can get all relevant (see point **5** in [this article](../Saving-Emails-in-Salesforce-1.-Function-Overview/#under_the_hood_mechanisms_and_special_patterns_applied_on_emails_saving)) incoming and outgoing email messages (*Inbox* and *Sent* folders) automatically saved in Salesforce. With automatic saving enabled, users' email messages will be automatically saved as Salesforce Tasks or [Email messages](http://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=emailadmin_enhanced_email_overview.htm&type=5) linked to related Contacts, Leads, and other Salesforce objects retrieved according to [these principles](../Initial-Search-and-Applied-Record-Filters/#the_resulting_related_records_list_will_include). Emails autosaving is performed not immediately but on the following [synchronization session](../Synchronization-Engine-An-Overview/).\n\n<br><br>\n\n**Auto-saving of events**\n\nUsers can have all their incoming and outgoing Calendar items automatically synced in Salesforce, with specific exceptions listed in [this article](../Calendars-Syncing-Exceptions/). Note that {{ company_name }} will also auto-create new Salesforce records to sync meetings which involve new business contact, see [this article](../Synchronization-Engine-An-Overview/#automatic_creation_of_contacts_or_leads_by_rg_email_sidebar_autoresolving) to learn the details.\n\nWith automatic meetings syncing enabled, the meetings will be automatically synced up to user's Salesforce calendar and also to the calendars of their colleagues who use {{ company_name }}, if they were invited.\n\n<br><br>\n\n**Auto-saving of appointments**\n\nWith automatic syncing of appointments enabled, users' appointments will be automatically synced with their Salesforce calendar. To enable automatic saving of appointments, toggle the **Auto-save appointments** switch button.\n\n<br><br>\n\n**Linking to Opportunities**\n\nUsers can have their emails associated not only with Contacts and Leads, but also with related Opportunities, saved to Salesforce. These related Opportunities must satisfy all of the following requirements:\n\n*   User is the owner of the Opportunity\n*   The account associated with the Opportunity contains a contact of the person whose email address is specified in the From, To, or CC fields\n\nIf several Opportunities satisfy these requirements, the email will be saved to the most recent one. If such an Opportunity was not found, the email will be saved to the Account that is associated with the related Contact. However, if neither an Opportunity nor an associated Account were found, the email will not be saved at all. This setting applies only to automatic email/event saving, not to manual saving of events/emails.\n\n<br><br>\n\n**Blocklisting emails and domains from syncing**\n\n{{ company_name }} offers the possibility to **blocklist** email messages and calendar items from/to certain addresses or domains from being saved with Salesforce (e.g., private contacts or in-org ones).\n\nNote that a special global setting blocklists all free email services (e.g., *gmail.com*, *outlook.com*, etc.) from syncing by default, so you don\u2019t need to add all of them to the Blocklist. To change or customize this setting, contact our [support team](mailto:support@revenuegrid.com).\n\n<br>\nSee [this article](../Blocklisting-Email-Addresses-and-Domains/) for more information on **Blocklisting Email Addresses and Domains** with {{ product_name }}.\n\n<br>\n\n**Message deduplication**\n\nWith this switch button enabled, {{ short_company_name }} Sync Engine will prevent users from saving an email message which has already been saved by another user. This mechanism ensures that no excessive duplicates are created in Salesforce. \n\n<br>\n\n**Email deduplication field** \n\nThis field is related to the Message deduplication setting described above, it is automatically prefilled with the \u201c*REVGRD__InternetMessageId__c*\u201d value, the name of the custom field added by {{ company_name }} Salesforce managed package (if it\u2019s installed). However, admins can specify here another custom field name which will be used for emails deduplication. \n\n<br> \n\n**Email direction field (name)** \n\nIn this field admins can specify custom field for storing Email directions (whether an email message is inbound or outbound). For example, \u201c*Direction_c*\u201d \n\n<br> \n\n**Enable/disable email threads auto-sharing** \n\nEnable/disable automatic saving of all emails which belong to a correspondence thread in Salesforce. There is the [corresponding synchronization setting on the user-level](../Configuring-Activities-Synchronization-Settings/#automatic_saving_of_email_threads). \n\n<br> \n\n**Thread Id field** \n\nThis field is related to the *Enable/disable email threads auto-sharing setting* described above; it is used for automatic saving of emails by the conversation identifier. To enable this feature, specify the name of the custom Salesforce field which contains the conversation identifier in this field.  \n\nThis setting is required if email messages are saved as *Task*. If emails are saved as EmailMessage, leave this field empty (*EmailMessage* will contain a *ThreadIdentifier* field by default). \n\n\n\n<br><br>\n\n##### Sidebar\n\n<img src=\"..\\..\\assets\\images\\new-admin-panel\\profiles\\sidebar.png\" style=\"width:50%; display:inline-block; vertical-align:middle; margin-left:10px; float: right\">\n\n{{ product_name }} Customization page which allows the individual users to adjust various aspects of interaction between Salesforce and {{ short_name }} Outlook Add-In / Chrome Extension. This includes viewing, processing, and search patterns for different types of objects and their fields, see the left and central panes of the page.\n\nIn the Sidebar section, admins can specify the default Customization for a Profile and customization management rules for users.\n\n\n<br>\n\n**Set the default Customization for Org**  \n\nSelect the default Sidebar Customization which will be automatically applied for all new users whose Customization settings got reset to default.\n\n<br>\n\n**Customization management for users**\n\nEnable this switch button to allow users in the Profile to change, apply or push the Add-In Customization settings.\n\n<br>\n\n##### Miscellaneous\n<img src=\"..\\..\\assets\\images\\new-admin-panel\\profiles\\misc.png\" style=\"width:50%; display:inline-block; vertical-align:middle; margin-left:10px; float: right\">\n\nIn the Miscellaneous section, you can specify Profile-wide settings for users.\n\n\n\n<br><br><br>\n**Select the default plan for users**  \n\nHere, admins can specify what plan should be assigned to the users belonging to this Profile. This is useful for managing different teams which use different {{ company_name }} product packages or need specific sets of settings.\n\n<br>\n\n**Users categorizing according to email domains**\n\nAdmins can ensure that new users with specific email domains are automatically assigned to this Profile. \n\n<br>\n\n**Attached file extensions allowlist**\n\nSpecify what attached file types should be allowed to be saved in Salesforce.\n\n\n<br>\n<hr>\n<br>\n\n\n#### **Users** \u2013 the subtab displays the list of users which belong to the Profile\n\nThe subtab includes a number of columns (these can be added or removed via the menu summoned by clicking the <img src=\"..\\..\\assets\\images\\new-admin-panel\\licenses\\tune-normal.svg\" style=\"display:inline-block; vertical-align:middle; margin:1px; object-fit:contain;\"> (**Menu**) icon).\n\n*   **Name**\n*   **Email**\n*   **Profile**\n*   **License**\n*   **Mailbox access type**\n*   **User ID**\n*   **Issues**\n*   **Last synchronization session**\n*   **Synchronization status**\n*   **Disabled due to an error**\n*   **Mailbox Status**\n*   **Created On**\n*   **Updated On**\n*   **Delegates**\n*   **SMS #**\n*   **Voice #**\n*   **Sequence role**\n*   **Created On**\n*   **Actions**\n\n<br>\n\n**Actions available on the Users subtab**\n\nTo open the Actions menu, select any user and click on the three dots menu on the left. \n\n<p><img src=\"..\\..\\assets\\images\\new-admin-panel\\users\\actions.png\" class=\"minimized\">\n</p>\n\n!!! note \"Note\"\n    If you don't see the Actions column, try scrolling the page to the right and check whether this column is selected for display.\n\n**Delete**. Delete a user. Please note that Users with initialized mailbox cannot be deleted\n\n**Force delete**. Delete a user, users with initialized mailbox can be deleted this way\n\n**Reset mailbox**. Request {{ product_name }} to remove user customization and keep synchronization disabled. Once synchronization is enabled again, the first synchronization attempt will apply the customization to the user\u2019s mailbox\n\n**Re-initialize mailbox**. Request {{ product_name }} to refresh mailbox data access for the user. Re-initializing is performed to resolve errors which affected data parsing consistency in the mailbox\n\n**Check settings**.

Enable synchronization for a User, if it was disabled\n\n**Disable synchronization**. Suspend synchronization for a user. If synchronization is suspended for an ordinary User, it can be resumed from the Sync Dashboard\n\n**Force synchronization**. Standard synchronization interval is set to 30 minutes. A user can manually trigger synchronization outside of the standard sync schedule by clicking the Force Synchronization action, but no sooner than 1 minute after the last attempt to trigger it. This is done to avoid service overload in case of multiple consecutive \u201cForce Synchronization\u201d requests\n\t\t\n**Install Sidebar**. Run this action to easily install {{ short_name }} Add-In for MS Outlook for the user's account. That is only viable if the Sync Engine was authorized to work with the user's mail server data\n\n**Remove Sidebar**. Run this action to uninstall {{ short_name }} Add-In for MS Outlook from this user account\n\n**Reset Sidebar customization**. Resets the user's Customization settings to the default state configured by the Admin or {{ short_name }} Support Team\n\n&nbsp;\n***\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n#### **Statistics** \u2013 the subtab displays statistics about the last synchronization session for each User in the Profile\n\nYou can check all the details about the item you need by clicking it. \n\nThe subtab has the following columns that can be added or removed via the menu summoned by clicking the  <img src=\"..\\..\\assets\\images\\new-admin-panel\\licenses\\tune-normal.svg\" style=\"display:inline-block; vertical-align:middle; margin:1px; object-fit:contain;\">(**Menu**) icon:\n\n* **Job ID** (hidden by default)\n\n* **User**\n\n* **Synchronization start date**\n\n* **Synchronization end date**\n\n* **Status**\n\n* **Synchronization Scope**\n\n* **Changes**\n\n* **Issues**\n\n* **Error Category**\n\n* **Error Source**\n\n* **Message**\n\n* **Exception** (hidden by default)\n\n* **Actions**.

When the access type is selected and configured, it is applied to all users in the organization. The users can only use the defined type to access their mailboxes.  \nWhen a new Organization is created, specify the type of mailbox access to be used for the Organization\u2019s Users. When the access type is selected and configured, it is applied to all Users in the Organization. The Users can access their mailboxes only using the chosen access type.  \n\nYou can edit the user\u2019s name and mailbox settings which were specified during the provisioning process or defined by the organization which the user belongs to.  \n\n&nbsp;\n\n#### Configuring Connection Type for a Profile\n\n!!! tip \"Tip\"\n    Also see [this article](../Email-Integration-Full-Deployment-Scenarios/) for information on all available {{ product_name }} full deployment scenarios \n\n&nbsp;\n\nAs new mailbox compatibilities and deployment scenarios are implemented, more options are added to available **Mailbox Access Type** options:  \n\n- Microsoft Exchange basic authorization (EWS API) - End User logon\n- Microsoft Exchange basic authorization (EWS API) - Impersonated logon\n- Microsoft 365 OAuth (EWS API) - End User logon\n- Microsoft 365 OAuth (Graph API) - End User logon\n- Microsoft 365 OAuth (EWS API) - Impersonated logon\n- Microsoft 365 OAuth (Graph API) - App-only access logon\n- Google Direct Logon\n- Google Service Account  \n\n<p><img src=\"..\\..\\assets\\images\\new-admin-panel\\profiles\\access-types.png\" style=\"width:60%;\" class=\"minimized\">\n</p>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n##### Microsoft Exchange basic authorization (EWS API) - End User logon\n\nThe typical scenario where the end users enter their Exchange logon credentials in [{{ product_name }}](../Authorizing-Sync-Engine-to-Work-with-Your-Data/#activate_ri_sync_for_ms_exchange) to activate the Sync engine. \n\n&nbsp; \n\n##### Microsoft Exchange basic authorization (EWS API) - Impersonated logon\n\n[Microsoft Exchange Impersonation](../Setting-Up-Impersonated-Access-and-Configuring-Mailbox-Access-for-Organizations-and-Users/) is used to mass-authorize in {{ product_name }} end users with MS Exchange mail accounts via an impersonating service account. Before setting the this access type, you must obtain the [Exchange EWS URL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/exchange/client-developer/exchange-web-services/explore-the-ews-managed-api-ews-and-web-services-in-exchange) and a configured [Impersonating account](../Impersonation-O365/)'s login and password. See [this article](../Set-up-An-Impersonation-Service-Account/) for detailed steps how to configure everything for this access type.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n##### Microsoft 365 OAuth (EWS API) - End User logon\n\nThis option is used to authorize in {{ product_name }} end users with Office 365 mail accounts over Office 365 OAuth. See [this article](../Authorizing-Sync-Engine-to-Work-with-Your-Data/#activate_ri_sync_for_office_365) for more information. In the latest product updates it is the default option for bulk O365 users authorization [using a Service account](../Impersonation-O365/).\n\n&nbsp;\n\n##### Microsoft 365 OAuth (Graph API) - End User logon\n\nThis option is used to authorize in {{ product_name }} end users with Office 365 mail accounts over [MS Graph](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/overview). See [this article](../MS-Graph/) for more information. Also see [this article](../MS-Graph/#ms_graph_limitations) to learn about limitations presently associated with this connection type.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n##### Microsoft 365 OAuth (EWS API) - Impersonated logon\n\nThis option is used to mass-authorize in {{ product_name }} end users with Office 365 mail accounts via an [impersonating account](../Setting-Up-Impersonated-Access-and-Configuring-Mailbox-Access-for-Organizations-and-Users/). To use this access type, you must have mail server and {{ product_name }} Admin account credentials. See [this article](../Impersonation-O365/) for detailed steps how to configure everything for this access type.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n##### Microsoft 365 OAuth (Graph API) - App-only access logon\n\nThis option is used to mass-authorize in {{ product_name }} end users with Office 365 mail accounts via app-only acccess with MS Graph API. To use this access type, you must have mail server and {{ product_name }} Admin account credentials. See [this article](../Impersonation-Graph/) for detailed steps how to configure everything for this access type. Also see [this article](../MS-Graph/#ms_graph_limitations) to learn about limitations presently associated with this connection type.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n##### **Google Direct Logon**\n\nThis option is used to authorize in {{ product_name }} end users with Gmail / Google Workspace accounts over Gmail OAuth. The users will need to authorize it individually. See [this article](../How-to-Set-Up-the-Chrome-Extension-for-Salesforce-and-Gmail/) for more information.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n##### **Google Service Account**\n\nThis option is used to [mass-authorize in {{ product_name }}](../Gmail-Users-Mass-Provisioning/) end users with Gmail / Google Workspace accounts. See [this article](../Gmail-Service-Account/) for more information.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n##### {{ company_name }} Compatibility\n\nPresently, due to data access authorization specifics, only connection types *MS Exchange Direct Logon*, *Office 365 OAuth*, *Google Service Account* (partial), and *Google Direct Logon* are supported by the [full {{ company_name }} solution](https://docs.revenuegrid.com/). Via a custom workaround {{ company_name }} is also compatible with MS Graph; in this scenario, {{ company_name }} is configured to run over EWS tokens and {{ company_name }} works over MS Graph.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n* * *\n\n&nbsp;\n\n#### Disabling synchronization for a Profile\n\nTo disable synchronization for all users belonging to a Profile:  \n\n**1\\.** Go to the **Profiles** tab\n\n**2\\.** From the list of Profiles, select the Profile you want to delete, and then click on the **three dots** icon in the Actions column\n\n**3\\.** Select **Disable synchronization** from the list of available actions\n\n<p><img src=\"..\\..\\assets\\images\\new-admin-panel\\profiles\\disable-sync.png\" class=\"minimized\">\n</p>\n\n<br>\n<hr>\n<br>\n\n#### **Deleting Profiles**\n\nPlease note that you can delete a Profile only if it has no users with initialized [Exchange Storage](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/exchange/plan-and-deploy/deployment-ref/storage-configuration?view=exchserver-2019). If at least one user is initialized, you must delete the user first, and then the Profile. After you delete a Profile, all users that belong to it will be irrecoverably deleted.  \nAlso note that you cannot delete a default Profile.\n\nTo delete an existing Profile:  \n\n**1\\.** Go to the **Profiles** tab\n\n**2\\.** From the list of Profiles, find the Profile you want to delete, and then click on the **three dots** icon in the Actions column\n\n**3\\.** Select **Delete** from the list of available actions\n\n<p><img src=\"..\\..\\assets\\images\\new-admin-panel\\profiles\\delete-menu.png\" class=\"minimized\">\n</p>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**4\\.** In the confirmation message that appears, click **Delete**\n\n<p><img src=\"..\\..\\assets\\images\\new-admin-panel\\profiles\\delete.png\" style=\"width:60%\">\n</p>\n\n<br>\n<hr>\n<br>\n\n \n## Managing Organizations in the lagacy Admin Panel\n \n!!! warning \"Important\"\n    In March 2023 release, the new Admin Panel was introduced.

Before setting the this access type, you must obtain the [Exchange EWS URL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/exchange/client-developer/exchange-web-services/explore-the-ews-managed-api-ews-and-web-services-in-exchange) and a configured [Impersonating account](../Impersonation-O365/)'s login and password. See [this article](../Set-up-An-Impersonation-Service-Account/) for detailed steps how to configure everything for this access type.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n##### Microsoft 365 OAuth (EWS API) - End User logon\n\nThis option is used to authorize in {{ product_name }} end users with Office 365 mail accounts over Office 365 OAuth. See [this article](../Authorizing-Sync-Engine-to-Work-with-Your-Data/#activate_ri_sync_for_office_365) for more information. In the latest product updates it is the default option for bulk O365 users authorization [using a Service account](../Impersonation-O365/).\n\n&nbsp;\n\n##### Microsoft 365 OAuth (Graph API) - End User logon\n\nThis option is used to authorize in {{ product_name }} end users with Office 365 mail accounts over [MS Graph](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/overview). See [this article](../MS-Graph/) for more information. Also see [this article](../MS-Graph/#ms_graph_limitations) to learn about limitations presently associated with this connection type.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n##### Microsoft 365 OAuth (EWS API) - Impersonated logon\n\nThis option is used to mass-authorize in {{ product_name }} end users with Office 365 mail accounts via an [impersonating account](../Setting-Up-Impersonated-Access-and-Configuring-Mailbox-Access-for-Organizations-and-Users/). To use this access type, you must have mail server and {{ product_name }} Admin account credentials. See [this article](../Impersonation-O365/) for detailed steps how to configure everything for this access type.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n##### Microsoft 365 OAuth (Graph API) - Impersonated logon\n\nThis option is used to mass-authorize in {{ product_name }} end users with Office 365 mail accounts via app-only access with MS Graph API. To use this access type, you must have mail server and {{ product_name }} Admin account credentials. See [this article](../Impersonation-Graph/) for detailed steps how to configure everything for this access type. Also see [this article](../MS-Graph/#ms_graph_limitations) to learn about limitations presently associated with this connection type.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n##### **Google Direct Logon**\n\nThis option is used to authorize in {{ product_name }} end users with Gmail / Google Workspace accounts over Gmail OAuth. The users will need to authorize it individually. See [this article](../How-to-Set-Up-the-Chrome-Extension-for-Salesforce-and-Gmail/) for more information.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n##### **Google Service Account**\n\nThis option is used to [mass-authorize in {{ product_name }}](../Gmail-Users-Mass-Provisioning/) end users with Gmail / Google Workspace accounts. See [this article](../Gmail-Service-Account/) for more information.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n##### {{ company_name }} Compatibility\n\nPresently, due to data access authorization specifics, only connection types *MS Exchange Direct Logon*, *Office 365 OAuth*, *Google Service Account* (partial), and *Google Direct Logon* are supported by the [full {{ company_name }} solution](https://docs.revenuegrid.com/). Via a custom workaround {{ company_name }} is also compatible with MS Graph; in this scenario, {{ company_name }} is configured to run over EWS tokens and {{ company_name }} works over MS Graph.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n* * *\n\n&nbsp;\n\n#### **Deleting Organizations**\n\nPlease note that you can delete an Organization only if it has no users with initialized [Exchange Storage](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/exchange/plan-and-deploy/deployment-ref/storage-configuration?view=exchserver-2019). If at least one user is initialized, you must delete the user first, and then the Organization. After you delete an Organization, all users that belong to it will be irrecoverably deleted.  \nAlso note that you cannot delete a default Organization.\n\nTo delete an existing organization:  \n\n**1\\.** Go to the **Organizations** tab\n\n**2\\.** From the list of organizations, select the organization you want to delete, and then click the **Delete** icon\n\n<p><img src=\"../../assets/images/d33v4339jhl8k0cloudfrontnet/docs/assets/57398d2e903360669faf1f0a/images/5b1f8f9f0428632c466ac80e.png\" class=\"minimized\">\n</p>\n\n&nbsp;\n**3\\.** In the confirmation message that appears, click **Delete**\n\n![](../assets/images/d33v4339jhl8k0cloudfrontnet/docs/assets/57398d2e903360669faf1f0a/images/5b30f01c0428632c466b4a53.png)\n\n\n&#160;\n &#160;\n\n",
    "text_content": "description: Using RGES Admin panel, you can create, edit, define special sync settings, configure connection type for Organizations\nManaging Profiles via the Admin Panel\n For users of the Email Sidebar on: \n \n \n \n9 min read \n \n \n \n!!! warning \"Important\"\n In March 2023 release, the new Admin Panel was introduced. The support of the legacy Admin Panel will be ceased soon, thus we strongly encourage that our customers switch to the new Admin Panel. This article contains two sections:\n \u2022 Managing Profiles in the new Admin Panel\n \u2022 Managing Organizations in the legacy Admin Panel\nTo use {{ product_name }} Admin panel, special access permissions are required. To request the permissions for your organization, contact {{ company_name }} support team by email. Admin panel provides tools for managing end users and some of its key settings it includes duplicate {{ product_name }} Customization and Sync settings on Admin level.\nManaging Profiles in the new Admin Panel\nIn {{ product_name }} Administration Panel context, a Profile (previously, Organization) is a group of Users with shared basic settings which cooperate in a shared Salesforce space.\n \nThe Profiles tab of Administration Panel provides mechanisms for defining synchronization configuration for a Profile. \n!!! note \"Note\"\n In the current implementation there is no way to limit the access rights for Admin Users, so an assigned Admin User can manage users belonging to all Profiles locally \nProfiles List View\nOn the Profiles tab, you can see the following columns: \nID (this column is hidden by default)\nName\nMailbox access type\nSynchronization status\nActions\nClick any column name and select to sort ascending or sort descending.\n \n \n \nIn the Filter by box, you can select what Profiles to display by their Synchronization Status and Mailbox Access Type. Click on the X icon to clear the filter.\n \n \nClick the icon on the right to add or remove columns displayed on the Profiles tab.\n \nNote that no bulk actions can be performed on Profiles.\nIf synchronization is enabled and running, organization info on the list is displayed in black font color. If synchronization is not set up or is suspended for the whole Organization \u2013 it is displayed in red font color.\nVia the Profiles tab you can perform the following tasks: \nCreate Profiles\nView and edit Profiles' details\nDelete Profiles \nCreating Profiles\nTo create a profile: \n1. Go to the Profiles tab \n \n2. In the upper right corner of the page, click Create Profile in the upper right-hand corner of the interface\n3. Fill in the Name field \n4. Fill in the External Id field (the value becomes read-only and cannot be changed later) \n5. Click Save to complete Profile creation \nEditing Profiles\nTo modify a Profile:\n1. Go to the Profiles tab \n2. To edit or view a Profile, click on the necessary one on the list \n3. Switch to the Details subtab \n4. Edit the necessary Profile parameters \n5. Click Save \nViewing Profile Subtabs\nThere are the following subtabs on the Profiles tab which contain relevant sets of actions. \n!!! note \"Note\"\n The columns on the subtabs can be added or removed via the columns actions picklist summoned by clicking the (Menu) icon\nGeneral \u2013 the subtab for configuring general Profile settings\nThe General subtab contains settings that are common for all users belonging to this Profile. Users can change majority of these settings on their Sync Settings page, Sidebar Customization page. Once you change any settings on this page and save them, users won't be able to edit them on their Sync Settings page, Sidebar Customization page. However, you as an admin can change them anytime on this page.\n \n \n \nSync Settings\n \nSync section contains settings for fine-tuning and standardizing synchronization for users. These settings will apply to all users in the Profile and they won't be able to change them on their level.\nIn the Sync section, it is possible to push specific synchronization settings to all users belonging to a Profile, or to groups of users and individual users within a Profile; the users can be allowed or disallowed to adjust these settings. If you need to preset individual sync settings to different users in the Profile, send us a corresponding request to our Support team.\n \n \nAuto-saving of emails\nWith this setting enabled users can get all relevant (see point 5 in this article) incoming and outgoing email messages (Inbox and Sent folders) automatically saved in Salesforce. With automatic saving enabled, users' email messages will be automatically saved as Salesforce Tasks or Email messages linked to related Contacts, Leads, and other Salesforce objects retrieved according to these principles. Emails autosaving is performed not immediately but on the following synchronization session.\n \nAuto-saving of events\nUsers can have all their incoming and outgoing Calendar items automatically synced in Salesforce, with specific exceptions listed in this article. Note that {{ company_name }} will also auto-create new Salesforce records to sync meetings which involve new business contact, see this article to learn the details.\nWith automatic meetings syncing enabled, the meetings will be automatically synced up to user's Salesforce calendar and also to the calendars of their colleagues who use {{ company_name }}, if they were invited.\n \nAuto-saving of appointments\nWith automatic syncing of appointments enabled, users' appointments will be automatically synced with their Salesforce calendar. To enable automatic saving of appointments, toggle the Auto-save appointments switch button.\n \nLinking to Opportunities\nUsers can have their emails associated not only with Contacts and Leads, but also with related Opportunities, saved to Salesforce. These related Opportunities must satisfy all of the following requirements:\nUser is the owner of the Opportunity\nThe account associated with the Opportunity contains a contact of the person whose email address is specified in the From, To, or CC fields\nIf several Opportunities satisfy these requirements, the email will be saved to the most recent one. If such an Opportunity was not found, the email will be saved to the Account that is associated with the related Contact. However, if neither an Opportunity nor an associated Account were found, the email will not be saved at all. This setting applies only to automatic email/event saving, not to manual saving of events/emails.\n \nBlocklisting emails and domains from syncing\n{{ company_name }} offers the possibility to blocklist email messages and calendar items from/to certain addresses or domains from being saved with Salesforce (e.g., private contacts or in-org ones).\nNote that a special global setting blocklists all free email services (e.g., gmail.com, outlook.com, etc.) from syncing by default, so you don\u2019t need to add all of them to the Blocklist. To change or customize this setting, contact our support team.\n \nSee this article for more information on Blocklisting Email Addresses and Domains with {{ product_name }}.\n \nMessage deduplication\nWith this switch button enabled, {{ short_company_name }} Sync Engine will prevent users from saving an email message which has already been saved by another user.
