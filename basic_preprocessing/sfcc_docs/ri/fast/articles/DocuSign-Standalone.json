In this case, the user is accessing a centralized authentication server that all other applications and systems use.\nThe  following are requirements for using the Single Sign-on as the  authorization method. If these conditions are not met, then when the  user selects Authorize, they will be prompted to log in to DocuSign as  if Standard Authorization was selected.\n\n- The account must be configured in DocuSign for SSO\n- The account ID must be provided to the users as they setup their application\n- The user's default account must be setup for SSO\n\n&nbsp;\n\nTo log in with SSO:\n\n1.
