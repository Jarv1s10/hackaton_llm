Campaigns is among custom object types which are present in [Salesforce set of objects](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.api.meta/api/sforce_api_objects_list.htm), and in their case [enabling the Campaign object card on {{ short_name }} Customization page](../Customization-Settings-Explained/#5_choosing_a_set_of_salesforce_objects_to_display) alone is not enough to add them to {{ short_name }} handling scope. The first point to consider is that such objects may have one or more auxiliary related cards, for example a Campaign has associated *Campaign Member Status*, *Campaign Member*, and *Campaign Field History* cards. They contain additional object data, and their absence in {{ short_name }} processing scope results in primary objects, Campaigns in this case, not being retrieved by [{{ short_name }} initial search](../Initial-Search-and-Applied-Record-Filters/) (that is, brought up in [Related records lists](../Viewing-Salesforce-Records-Related-to-your-Email-(Adaptive-view)/) or by [user-initiated search](../Searching-for-Existing-Salesforce-Records-and-Creating-New-Records-%28Adaptive-view%29/).\n\nThis way, when adding a custom object to the processing scope via {{ short_name }} Customization page, make sure to search for its auxiliary cards, by entering the object's name in the *Quick Find...* field of [Customization page](../Customization-Settings-Explained/)'s left pane *\"Objects in Salesforce\"*, then enable all relevant cards.\n\n<p><img src=\"../../assets/images/d33v4339jhl8k0cloudfrontnet/docs/assets/57398d2e903360669faf1f0a/images/custom-object-auxiliary.png\" class=\"minimized\">\n</p>\n\n&nbsp;\n\nNext, click **Save** in the upper right corner of Customization page to apply the changes and [refresh the Add-In](../All-User-Actions-in-Add-In-Sidebar/#11_minor_interface_improvements).
