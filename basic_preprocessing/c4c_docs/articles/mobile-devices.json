Open MS Outlook Mobile App\n\n<p>\n<img src= \"..\\..\\assets\\images\\mobile-devices\\android-1.png\" style=\"width: 45%; height: 45%;\">\n</p>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n2.

On a mobile device, user can edit synchronized events. New events can\u2019t be shared with SAP Cloud for Customer because the native mobile calendar doesn\u2019t work with MS Exchange categories.\n\nIn the calendar app interface, it is impossible to distinguish whether a calendar event is synced from SAP Cloud for Customer or not.\n\nAs a workaround, user can create an appointment or visit in SSI Add-In through the MS Outlook Mobile app, force sync in the SSI, and, as soon as the sync is completed, the event will appear in the user\u2019s calendar on a mobile device.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n#### E-Mails\n\nUser can share e-mails using native mobile apps by moving them into the *SAP E-Mails* folder.
