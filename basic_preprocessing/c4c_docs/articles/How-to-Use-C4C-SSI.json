See [this article](../initial-search-and-applied-filters/) for more information.\n\nRelated Contacts and Individual Customers can be viewed in the Sidebar as detailed cards.\n\nRecord cards are expanded by default but can be minimized by clicking on their headers and \"putting them aside\" to free space on the Sidebar's home screen. Minimized cards display only 4 key record fields sufficient for their identification.\n\nIn addition, if you refer to a specific record card frequently, you can \"pin\" it to the top of the Sidebar, by clicking the <img src=\"../../assets/images/Icons/pin.png\" style=\"display: inline-block;vertical-align: middle;width: 18px;margin-left: 1px;height: 14px;object-fit: contain;\"> (Pin) icon in the record's header.

You can also open these records' detailed cards for reference or editing.\n\n![](../assets/images/Article1/related_records.png)\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n#### **4\\.** Using the Save button\n\nAfter a relevant Lead or Contact has been created (or found using [SSI search](../Search-Records/)), you can save an e-mail or a meeting/appointment in SAP Cloud for Customer linked to it. To do that:\n\n- [Open SAP Cloud for Customer SSI Sidebar](../How-to-Open-C4C-SSI-Sidebar/)  \n- Select/create an e-mail or open a meeting/appointment in MS Outlook  \n- In SSI Sidebar, click **Save this e-mail** (or **Save this Event**) at the bottom of a relevant SAP Cloud for Customer object  \n- (Optionally) modify the object's Subject on saving, if you want to name the matching SAP Cloud for Customer e-mail object differently\n- Click **Add** to save the e-mail or event  \n\n![](../assets/images/Article1/save-email-dialog.png)\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n#### **5\\.** Save files attached to e-mails in SAP Cloud for Customer\n\nIn the same *\"Save an E-Mail to SAP Cloud for Customer\"* dialog, you can select files attached to the e-mail which you want to save in SAP Cloud for Customer along with it.\n\n![](../assets/images/Article1/save-email-attachment.png)\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAdditionally, there is the **Attach** button on business records' cards, which can be used to attach files directly to business records.  \n\n![](../assets/images/Start/attach_button.png)\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n#### **6\\.** Find your contact on Facebook or LinkedIn, or open it in SAP Cloud for Customer\n\nWith SAP Cloud for Customer SSI, you can quickly find your contact's pages on social networks or open its record directly in SAP Cloud for Customer.
