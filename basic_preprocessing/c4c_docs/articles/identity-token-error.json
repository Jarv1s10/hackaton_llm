When starting SSI Add-In the following error message is shown:\n\n* \"*Unable to validate the client identity token. Please restart the e-mail client*\" or\n\n<p>\n<img src= \"..\\..\\assets\\images\\identity-token\\1.png\">\n</p>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n* \"*Unable to load the identity token. Please restart Microsoft Outlook*\"\n\n<p>\n<img src= \"..\\..\\assets\\images\\identity-token\\2.png\">\n</p>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n2. Customer is reporting that they cannot load the Add-In. It is saying \"*Looks like your login session has expired. We will refresh it*\" and then the Add-In is trying to load until it stops\n\n<p>\n<img src= \"..\\..\\assets\\images\\identity-token\\3.png\">\n</p>\n\n&nbsp;\n\nRestarting E-Mail client (MS Outlook) and resetting the MS Exchange password doesn't help.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n* * *\n\n&nbsp;\n\n## Causes\n\nThis issue is caused by a misconfiguration on the customer\u2019s MS Exchange server\\firewall. The identity token, which is used to authenticate a user in Add-In, contains an encoded Exchange MetaData URL, which is used to download Exchange meta-info and perform the validation process. Server-Side Integration is trying to connect to Exchange MetaData URL *https://somehost.com:443/autodiscover/metadata/json/1*, which is an internal resource in the customer\u2019s network and can not be accessed from the internet.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n* * *\n\n&nbsp;\n\n## Resolution\n\nTo resolve the issue, it is required properly configure Identity Token URL on the MS Exchange server to make it available from external networks.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nPlease note the items below to run SAP Cloud for Customer Server-Side Integration properly:\n\n* Make sure the MetaData URL *https://somehost.com:443/autodiscover/metadata/json/1* (where *somehost.com* is an Exchange server external URL) is available from external networks or the firewall is set to allow the connection from IP addresses listed [below](#productive_landscape_ip_addresses). If there is any authentication enabled to access this URL, it should be disabled as well.  \nFor example, try accessing the same URL in Office 365 (*<https://outlook.office365.com/autodiscover/metadata/json/1>*), a similar response is expected.\n\n* The Exchange server must accept incoming EWS (Exchange Web Services) calls from SAP Cloud for Customer Server-Side Integration. AutoDiscover may have to be set up. More details on AutoDiscover are available [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/office/exchange-server-2010/bb201695(v=exchg.141)).  \nSAP Cloud for Customer Server-Side Integration IP addresses to authorize on the Exchange server side are documented [below](#productive_landscape_ip_addresses). Incoming EWS calls can be assessed for legitimacy by checking that they originate from within this IP range and contain a valid JWT (JSON Web Token). Details about JWT are available [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook/add-ins/inside-the-identity-token).\n\n* The Exchange server is configured to generate JWTs properly, so they indicate the URL SAP Cloud for Customer Server-Side Integration utilized to connect to the Exchange server. That URL may be the same as the AutoDiscover URL and is referred to as the MetaData URL in the JWT. If SAP Cloud for Customer Server-Side Integration still doesn\u2019t work, a standard check to conduct is to review Certificates on the Exchange server and ensure their validity.\n\n<!--The first sentence is kinda weird and complicated; what is the meaning?-->\n\n* Make sure that EWS is properly configured to be available inside and outside of the organization by executing the following command:  \n    * *C:\\windows\\system32>Get-WebServicesVirtualDirectory |Select name, \\*url\\* | fl*\n\n* Exchange MetaData URL should be available from external networks, so if any proxy or firewall is used, make sure they are available from the internet.  \n\n<!--Who are 'they' - URL(s) or proxy/firewall??-->\n\n&nbsp;\n\n## Productive landscape (IP Addresses)\n\n<details><summary>>>>

    "text_content": "\"Unable to Validate the Client Identity Token\" Error when Starting Add-In\n[ This article is work-in-progress ]\nSymptoms\nWhen starting SSI Add-In the following error message is shown:\n\"Unable to validate the client identity token. Please restart the e-mail client\" or\n \n \n \n\"Unable to load the identity token. Please restart Microsoft Outlook\"\n \n \n \nCustomer is reporting that they cannot load the Add-In. It is saying \"Looks like your login session has expired. We will refresh it\" and then the Add-In is trying to load until it stops\n \n \n \nRestarting E-Mail client (MS Outlook) and resetting the MS Exchange password doesn't help.\nCauses\nThis issue is caused by a misconfiguration on the customer\u2019s MS Exchange server\\firewall. The identity token, which is used to authenticate a user in Add-In, contains an encoded Exchange MetaData URL, which is used to download Exchange meta-info and perform the validation process. Server-Side Integration is trying to connect to Exchange MetaData URL https://somehost.com:443/autodiscover/metadata/json/1, which is an internal resource in the customer\u2019s network and can not be accessed from the internet.\nResolution\nTo resolve the issue, it is required properly configure Identity Token URL on the MS Exchange server to make it available from external networks.\nPlease note the items below to run SAP Cloud for Customer Server-Side Integration properly:\nMake sure the MetaData URL https://somehost.com:443/autodiscover/metadata/json/1 (where somehost.com is an Exchange server external URL) is available from external networks or the firewall is set to allow the connection from IP addresses listed below. If there is any authentication enabled to access this URL, it should be disabled as well.\nFor example, try accessing the same URL in Office 365 (https://outlook.office365.com/autodiscover/metadata/json/1), a similar response is expected.\nThe Exchange server must accept incoming EWS (Exchange Web Services) calls from SAP Cloud for Customer Server-Side Integration. AutoDiscover may have to be set up. More details on AutoDiscover are available here.\nSAP Cloud for Customer Server-Side Integration IP addresses to authorize on the Exchange server side are documented below. Incoming EWS calls can be assessed for legitimacy by checking that they originate from within this IP range and contain a valid JWT (JSON Web Token). Details about JWT are available here.\nThe Exchange server is configured to generate JWTs properly, so they indicate the URL SAP Cloud for Customer Server-Side Integration utilized to connect to the Exchange server. That URL may be the same as the AutoDiscover URL and is referred to as the MetaData URL in the JWT. If SAP Cloud for Customer Server-Side Integration still doesn\u2019t work, a standard check to conduct is to review Certificates on the Exchange server and ensure their validity.\n \nMake sure that EWS is properly configured to be available inside and outside of the organization by executing the following command: \nC:\\windows\\system32>Get-WebServicesVirtualDirectory |Select name, *url* | fl\nExchange MetaData URL should be available from external networks, so if any proxy or firewall is used, make sure they are available from the internet. \n \nProductive landscape (IP Addresses)\n >>> Click to see SSI IP addresses \n \n IP addresses of SAP Cloud for Customer Server-Side Integration \n \n \n \n \n Location \n \n \n SU \n \n \n Resource \n \n \n Main location \n \n \n List of PIPs in IP range \n \n \n \n \n \n DR location \n \n \n List of PIPs in IP range \n \n \n Website (public DNS) \n \n \n \n \n WDC \n \n \n Wdcprod01 \n \n \n web, worker \n \n \n \n 40.89.246.90/31 \n \n \n \n 40.89.246.90, 40.89.246.91 \n \n \n Wdcprod-AKS Wdcprod01 \n \n \n \n 20.81.29.60/31 \n \n \n \n 20.81.29.60, 20.81.29.61 \n \n \n sapcfc-sap-wdcprod01-sync.c4c.invisiblesolutions.com \n \n \n \n \n WDC \n \n \n Wdctest01 \n \n \n web, worker \n \n \n \n 52.186.90.126/31 \n \n \n \n 52.186.90.126, 52.186.90.127 \n \n \n Wdctest-AKS Wdctest01 \n \n \n \n 20.84.212.112/31 \n \n \n \n 20.84.212.112, 20.84.212.113 \n \n \n sapcfc-sap-wdctest01-sync.c4c.invisiblesolutions.com \n \n \n \n \n WDC mod \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 20.121.86.250/31 \n \n \n \n 20.121.86.250; 20.121.86.251 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 52.228.162.70/31 \n \n \n \n 52.228.162.70; 52.228.162.71 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n FRA \n FRA mod \n \n \n Fraprod01-05 \n Fratest01 \n Fratest21 \n Fraprod21 \n \n \n web, worker \n \n \n \n 20.79.94.108/30 \n \n \n \n \n \n 20.79.101.104/30 \n \n \n \n \n \n 20.52.203.122/31 \n \n \n \n 20.79.89.96/30 \n \n \n \n 20.79.94.108, 20.79.94.109, 20.79.94.110, 20.79.94.111 \n 20.79.101.104, 20.79.101.105, 20.79.101.106, 20.79.101.107 \n 20.52.203.122, 20.52.203.123 \n 20.79.89.96; 20.79.89.97; 20.79.89.98; 20.79.89.99 \n \n \n \n Fratest-AKS Fratest01 Fraprod01 Fraprod&#8209;AKS \n Fraprod02 Fraprod03 Fraprod04 Fraprod05 \n Fratest21 \n \n Fraprod21 \n \n \n \n 20.50.236.104/30 \n \n \n \n \n \n 20.54.192.120/30 \n \n \n \n \n \n 51.105.215.150/31 \n \n \n \n 20.113.195.212/30 \n \n \n \n 20.50.236.104, 20.50.236.105, 20.50.236.106, 20.50.236.107 \n 20.54.192.120, 20.54.192.121, 20.54.192.122, 20.54.192.123 \n 51.105.215.150, 51.105.215.151 \n 20.113.195.212; 20.113.195.213; 20.113.195.214; 20.113.195.215 \n \n \n \n sapcfc-sap-fraprod [01..05] -sync.c4c.invisiblesolutions.com \n sapcfc-sap-fratest01-sync.c4c.invisiblesolutions.com \n sapcfc-sap-fratest21-sync.c4c.invisiblesolutions.com \n sapcfc-sap-fraprod21-sync.c4c.invisiblesolutions.com \n \n \n \n \n PER \n \n \n \n PER mod \n \n \n Perprod01 \n Pertest01 \n \n \n web, worker \n \n \n \n 40.115.90.12/31 \n \n \n \n 20.53.187.192/31 \n \n \n \n 20.70.88.90/31 \n \n \n \n 40.115.90.12, 40.115.90.13 \n 20.53.187.192, 20.53.187.193 \n 20.70.88.90; 20.70.88.91 \n \n \n PerProd-AKS PerProd01 \n Pertest-AKS Pertest01 \n \n \n \n 20.193.1.176/31 \n \n \n \n 13.70.173.238/31 \n \n \n \n 20.248.144.52/31 \n \n \n \n 20.193.1.176, 20.193.1.177 \n 13.70.173.238, 13.70.173.239 \n 20.248.144.52; 20.248.144.53 \n \n \n sapcfc-sap-perprod01-sync.c4c.invisiblesolutions.com \n sapcfc-sap-pertest01-sync.c4c.invisiblesolutions.com \n \n \n \n \n \nRelated resources\nGetting Internal Server Error 500 when creating New-CsPartnerApplication for Exchange 2013\nServer to Server communication is broken \u2013 how to fix it?"
