Please Enter a Different E-Mail Address\" Error\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**[ This article is work-in-progress ]**\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n## Symptoms\n\nWhen trying to provision the user or during auto-provisioning (when Key User opens **Groupware Settings** for the first time) user is getting message \"*ISS-046: E-Mail xxx@xxx.xxx is already taken. Please enter a different e-mail address*\", where *xxx@xxx.xxx* is user's e-mail address.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n* * *\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n## Causes\n\nThe issue occurs because identical e-mail addresses are used for the same users within one tenant.\n\nFor example, a USER1 with e-mail *user1@test.com* was provisioned a while ago. Then USER1 was deleted from SAP Cloud for Customer, however, it remained in Server-Side Integration. Now, when a new USER2 with the e-mail address *user1@test.com*, which is identical to the USER1's e-mail address, attempts to get provisioned \u2013 an error occurs.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n* * *\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n## Resolution\n\nTo resolve the issue the following options can be used:\n\n&nbsp;\n\n### Option 1\n\nGo to **E-Mail Integration** > **Groupware Settings** > **Users**. Find the affected user with the same e-mail address and either **Delete** or **Force delete** the user. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n### Option 2\n\nChange the e-mail address of the user you are trying to provision in SAP Cloud for Customer.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;",
