Only the recipient who has the private key that matches the public key used to encrypt the message can decipher the message for reading. Any recipient without the corresponding private key would see only garbled text. More details about encrypted e-mail can be found [here](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/encrypt-email-messages-373339cb-bf1a-4509-b296-802a39d801dc).\n\n**A digital signature** attached to an e-mail message offers another layer of security by assuring the recipient that you &#8211; not an imposter &#8211; signed the contents of the e-mail message. Your digital signature, which includes your certificate and public key, originates from your digital ID. And that digital ID serves as your unique digital mark and signals the recipient that the content hasn't been altered in transit. More details about the signed e-mail can be found [here](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/secure-messages-by-using-a-digital-signature-549ca2f1-a68f-4366-85fa-b3f4b5856fc6).\n\n&nbsp;\n\n* * *\n\n&nbsp;\n\n## How Encrypting and Digital Signature works\n\nThe Add-In supports native MS Outlook *encryption functionality* with certificates issued by different vendors.\n\nAfter MS Outlook is configured to encrypt e-mails, new buttons \"**Encrypt**\" and \"**Sign**\" are added to the ribbon of the e-mail.\n\n<p>\n<img src= \"..\\..\\assets\\images\\encrypted-signed-emails\\1.png\">\n</p>\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSuch e-mail has a corresponding sign that identifies this e-mail as encrypted one.\n\n<p>\n<img src= \"..\\..\\assets\\images\\encrypted-signed-emails\\2.png\">\n</p>\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIn order to exchange with encrypted e-mail, both users should obtain e-mail certificates and exchange with certificate public keys.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n* * *\n\n&nbsp;\n\n## Support of encrypted and signed e-mails\n\nThe complicated encryption and digital signing logic create many limitations which prevent SSI Sync and Add-In from properly operating.\n\nIn case the user selects an encrypted and/or signed e-mail message and tries to **open the Add-In**, the following error message will occur:\n\n\"*You cannot perform this action.
