You should have a **Key User** (administrator) SAP Cloud for Customer account\n2. Know the **User** who is experiencing issues\n3. Know the exact **date and time** when the issue occurred\n\n&nbsp;\n\n### Steps to proceed\n\n1. Log in to SAP Cloud for Customer with Key User account\n2. Go to **E-Mail Integration** > **Groupware Settings** > **Users**\n\n<p>\n<img src= \"..\\..\\assets\\images\\ssi-logs\\4.png\">\n</p>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n3. Search for an affected user by any convenient field, e.g. by *Name*, and open the user's page\n\n<p>\n<img src= \"..\\..\\assets\\images\\ssi-logs\\5.png\">\n</p>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n4. Go to the **Statistics** tab and find a sync session by date or status. Type in \"*Error*\" to the status field to filter out only failed sync sessions\n\n5. In the *Actions* column, click the **Download Logs** button to download logs\n\n<p>\n<img src= \"..\\..\\assets\\images\\ssi-logs\\6.png\">\n</p>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n6. A pack of logs should be downloaded in a **.zip archive**, which can be investigated further to find the root cause of the issue\n\n&nbsp;\n\n* * *\n\n&nbsp;\n\n## Types of logs written by Server-Side Integration\n\nSAP Cloud for Customer Server-Side Integration stores the following types of logs:\n\n<table data-layout=\"default\">\n    <tbody>\n        <tr>\n            <th>\n                <p>Log name</p>\n            </th>\n            <th>\n                <p>Description</p>\n            </th>\n            <th>\n                <p>Log format</p>\n            </th>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>\n                <p>\n                    <strong>C4C Dump</strong>\n                </p>\n            </td>\n            <td>\n                <p>Contains an HTTP trace of synchronization session between SAP Cloud for Customer and Server-Side Integration connector</p>\n            </td>\n            <td>\n                <p>.txt</p>\n            </td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>\n                <p>\n                    <strong>Configuration</strong>\n                </p>\n            </td>\n            <td>\n                <p>Contains a list of settings that were used during synchronization</p>\n            </td>\n            <td>\n                <p>.xml</p>\n            </td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>\n                <p>\n                    <strong>Exchange Data Dump</strong>\n                </p>\n            </td>\n            <td>\n                <p>Contains data trace between the Server-Side Integration connector and Microsoft Exchange server and a list of actions performed in Exchange storage</p>\n            </td>\n            <td>\n                <p>.xml</p>\n            </td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>\n                <p>\n                    <strong>Sync Dump</strong>\n                </p>\n            </td>\n            <td>\n                <p>Synchronization trace between 2 storages: SAP Cloud for Customer and Exchange</p>\n            </td>\n            <td>\n                <p>.xml</p>\n            </td>\n        </tr>\n    </tbody>\n</table>\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe following additional information is also stored in the **.zip archive** along with logs:\n\n* *autoresolvers.xml* \u2013 contains auto-resolver rules in case of synchronization conflict\n* *Site.xml* \u2013 a list of settings\n* *synchronization_scheme.xml* \u2013 mapping scheme for different object types\n* *.json* \u2013 contains cached information for each object type to suppress synchronization, if some fields were updated on SAP Cloud for Customer, which is not used in synchronization\n* *job.txt* \u2013 contains a list of all jobs, which were performed by connectors during synchronization\n\n\n<!-- Need to clarify the list and types of logs/dump contained in .zip archive -->\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n",
