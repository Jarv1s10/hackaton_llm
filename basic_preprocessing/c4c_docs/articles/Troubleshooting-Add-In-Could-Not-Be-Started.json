This add-in could not be started. Close this dialog to ignore the problem or click \"Restart\" to try again*\" appears on opening the Add-In in MS Outlook, that might be caused an issue with [Sidebar](../Introduction/) rendering. This article describes the ways to resolve the issue. The solutions are only applicable for MS Outlook Desktop for Windows. \n\n![](../assets/images/Troubleshooting/add-in-error.png)\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n### Solution 1: Refresh Microsoft Browser Configuration\n\nThe error may occur with various Add-Ins / plugins installed in MS Outlook Desktop for Windows. The below guidelines are official ones provided by Microsoft.  \n\nThe first step is to determine the versions of Windows OS and MS Outlook that you are using. These versions define  which native Microsoft browser is used to render MS Outlook Add-Ins; that might be MS Edge or MS Internet Explorer.\n\nSee [this Microsoft article](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office/dev/add-ins/concepts/browsers-used-by-office-web-add-ins) to find out which one is used in your system based on your Windows version and Office package version combination. Users running the latest Windows 10 and Microsoft 365 Office updates typically have their Add-Ins rendered by MS Edge.\n\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n#### If your system uses MS Edge\n\nSometimes the error is caused by [MS Desktop App Web Viewer](https://appsource.microsoft.com/en-us/product/office/WA104295828?tab=Overview) getting corrupt. Take the steps below to re-install this module.  \n\n**1\\.** Close all MS Office apps running in your system, including MS Outlook  \n**2\\.** Run the following cmdlet in Windows PowerShell or command line on your PC, with Admin permissions:  \n\n```\npowershell Add-AppxPackage -register -disable {Windows folder on system disk path e.g. 'C:\\Windows\\'}\\SystemApps\\Microsoft.Win32WebViewHost_cw5n1h2txyewy\\AppxManifest.xml\n```\n\n**3\\.** Run MS Outlook and try [opening SSI Add-In](../How-to-Open-C4C-SSI-Sidebar/) to see if the issue was resolved  \n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n#### If none of Microsoft Add-Ins work or Sidebar controls become unclickable (WebView2 runtime)\n\nThe issue where important [Sidebar elements](../Introduction/) become unclickable, e.g. the *Save* or *Create* button, has a technical cause on Microsoft Outlook side. Specifically, due to the ongoing Microsoft transition from old MS Edge to [Chromium MS Edge](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/download-the-new-microsoft-edge-based-on-chromium-0f4a3dd7-55df-60f5-739f-00010dba52cf) some MS Outlook for Windows versions have an interface frames rendering issue with MS Edge. Microsoft is planning to roll out a complete solution in a [future MS Windows update](https://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2020/10/19/edge-webview2-general-availability/).\n\nAn official workaround [provided by Microsoft](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/office/blogs/office-add-ins-community-call-february-10-2021/):  \n\n!!! note \"Note\"\n    The workaround works only for Windows 10 and Office 365 or Microsoft 365 package version *16.0.13530.20424* or newer.

Browse [this Microsoft resource](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/webview2/#download-section) for versions compatible with different MS Edge builds and x86, x64, or arm64 architecture.  \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**4\\.** Open your Downloads folder and [install Webview2 on your Windows system](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/deployoffice/webview2-install#webview2-runtime-installation).

There are several possible solutions for Internet Explorer:  \n\n&nbsp;\n\n#### Check your Internet Explorer\n\nMake sure that you have the latest version of Internet Explorer installed, as described in [this Microsoft article](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/run-the-latest-version-of-internet-explorer-11-ea628df4-50ce-8019-f9f4-468e39685cea).\n\nIf needed, re-activate Internet Explorer in your Windows system:\n\n**1\\.** Press the **Windows key + R**, type *control* and press Enter   \n**2\\.** Click **Programs**  \n**3\\.** Click **Programs and Features**  \n**4\\.** Select **Turn Windows features on or off**  \n**5\\.** Select the checkbox next to *Internet Explorer 11*  \n**6\\.** Reboot Windows to apply the changes, then check if the issue was resolved\n\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\n##### Fix Internet Explorer Settings, if they got corrupt\n\n**1\\.** Press the **Windows key + R**, type *inetcpl.cpl* and press Enter to open Internet Explorer's *Internet Options*  \n**2\\.** Open the tab **Advanced**   \n**3\\.** Click **Reset** under **Reset Internet Explorer Settings**  \n**4\\.** Click **Reset** under **Are you sure you want to reset all Internet Explorer settings?**  \n**5\\.** As soon as the changes are applied, click **Close** and then **OK**  \n**6\\.** Reboot your Windows to apply changes, then check if the issue was resolved  \n\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\n##### Install System Updates\n\nTo get maximum performance and compatibility, all SSI users are recommended to upgrade to Windows 10 build *1903 or above* and Microsoft 365 / Office package version *16.013530* or above.\n\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\n##### Enable Protected Mode in Internet Explorer\n\nIn case upgrading is not an option, you can try enabling *Protected mode* in MS Internet Explorer.
