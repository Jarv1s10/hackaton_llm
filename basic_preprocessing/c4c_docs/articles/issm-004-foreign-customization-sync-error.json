The initial tenant URL is shown in the error message. Potential case: if a user with the same mailbox switches from test to production tenant using **Force Delete** feature; or if a user was not deleted at all. In this case, the data structure remains in the user\u2019s mailbox, and such an error message would be shown to the user.\n\nTo avoid this from happening again, the user should be deprovisioned from the tenant using the standard **Delete** feature in **E-Mail Integration** > **Groupware Settings** > **Users** before switching to a different tenant. Connection to the mailbox should be established so the data structure clean-up can be executed appropriately during deletion.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n* * *\n\n&nbsp;\n\n## Resolution\n\nThere are two methods available to resolve the issue:\n\n&nbsp;\n\n#### Method 1 (recommended)\n\n1. If you still have access to the initial tenant, which is shown in the message, log in to that tenant as a Key User\n2. Go to **E-Mail Integration** > **Groupware Setting** > **Users** and find a user who is experiencing an error\n3. Open the user profile, click the \"**Gear**\" button in the upper right corner and click **Reset mailbox**\n\n<p>\n<img src= \"..\\..\\assets\\images\\issm-004-foreign-customization\\2.png\">\n</p>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n4. Once mailbox is reset, log in to the new tenant and start the synchronization\n\n&nbsp;\n\n#### Method 2\n\n1. Log in as a Key User on affected tenant\n2. Go to **E-Mail Integration** > **Groupware Setting** > **Users** and find a user, who is experiencing an error\n3. Open the user profile, click the \"**Gear**\" button in the upper right corner and click **Re-initialize User's mailbox**\n\n<p>\n<img src= \"..\\..\\assets\\images\\issm-004-foreign-customization\\3.png\">\n</p>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n4.
