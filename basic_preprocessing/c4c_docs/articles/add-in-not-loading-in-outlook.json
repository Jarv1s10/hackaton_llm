Proceed with the following steps to investigate and resolve the issue.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n## Check Add-In status\n\n1. Make sure the Add-In is installed by verifying its status in SAP Cloud for Customer. Go to **E&#8209;Mail Integration** > **Groupware Settings** > **Users**. Find and open the affected user, click the \"Gear\" button in the upper right corner and click **Check Add-in Status**\n\n<p>\n<img src= \"..\\..\\assets\\images\\add-in-not-loading-in-outlook\\1.png\">\n</p>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n2. Upon the check of the Add-In Status, you should obtain the following result messages:\n\n<p>\n<img src= \"..\\..\\assets\\images\\add-in-not-loading-in-outlook\\2.png\">\n</p>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n3. Log in to Exchange server Outlook Web Access (OWA) or open MS Office 365 account in a web browser and make sure Add-In is loading successfully\n\n<p>\n<img src= \"..\\..\\assets\\images\\add-in-not-loading-in-outlook\\4.png\">\n</p>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n* * *\n\n&nbsp;\n\n## Check the current MS Outlook version\n\nIf Add-In works in OWA but doesn't load in MS Outlook \u2013 check the current MS Outlook version and make sure the most recent updates are installed. Also, refer to additional information about versions on the Microsoft page [here](http://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/31133.outlook-and-outlook-for-mac-update-file-versions.aspx#A).\n\nTry to install any other free Add-In from the MS Office store and check, if it works.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n* * *\n\n&nbsp;\n\n## Clear Add-In local storage\n\n<p>\n    <img src=\"..\\..\\assets\\images\\add-in-not-loading-in-outlook\\inspect.png\" style=\"width:36.37%; display:inline-block; vertical-align:middle; margin-left:8px;float: right\">\n</p>\n\n<br>\n<b>1.</b> Open SSI in your MS Outlook, right-click on the Add-In area and select **Inspect** in the contextual menu to open the **DevTools** window\n\n* If nothing happens when you right-click on the Add-In area, alternatively, you can use **Microsoft Edge DevTools Preview**. [Get it in Microsoft Store](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/microsoft-edge-devtools-preview/9MZBFRMZ0MNJ?hl=en-us&gl=us&rtc=2&source=lp&activetab=pivot%3Aoverviewtab) and refer to [this article](../capture-har-file/) to learn how to use it\n\n<br><br><br>\n\n* If none of the above options work, most likely the Add-In runs on Internet Explorer, so you need to use [**IEChooser**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/dev/add-ins/testing/debug-add-ins-using-f12-tools-ie). To launch IEChooser:\n    * Open [File Explorer](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/find-and-open-file-explorer-ef370130-1cca-9dc5-e0df-2f7416fe1cb1#WindowsVersion=Windows_10), copy the path *C:\\Windows\\System32\\F12\\IEChooser.exe*, paste it to the address field in the File Explorer window, and press **Enter** on the keyboard. Then proceed with steps as with Microsoft Edge DevTools\n\n<br><br>\n\n<b>2.</b> In the opened DevTools window, go to the **Application** tab\n\n<p>\n<img src= \"..\\..\\assets\\images\\add-in-not-loading-in-outlook\\application.png\">\n</p>\n\n<br>\n\n<p>\n    <img src=\"..\\..\\assets\\images\\add-in-not-loading-in-outlook\\storage.png\" style=\"width:26.19%; display:inline-block; vertical-align:middle; margin-left:10px;float: right\">\n</p>\n\n<br>\n<b>3.</b> On the left-hand **Storage** pane, expand **Local Storage** and select the option that appeared below\n\n<br><br><br>\n\n<b>4.</b> Click the **&osol; Clear All** button to clear the Add-In local storage\n\n<p>\n<img src= \"..\\..\\assets\\images\\add-in-not-loading-in-outlook\\clear-all.png\">\n</p>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n* * *\n\n&nbsp;\n\n## Clear the MS Office cache\n\nSometimes changes to Add-In commands, such as the icon for a ribbon button or the text of a menu item, do not seem to take effect. Clear the MS Office cache of the old versions. Delete the content of folder *%LocalAppData%\\Microsoft\\Office\\15.0\\WEF* (for MS Office 2016, it would be 16.0) and restart MS Outlook.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;",
