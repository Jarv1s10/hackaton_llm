To address that, spread [this article](../How-to-Configure-User/) among the end users\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n## 1\\. Deployment considerations\n\nSAP Cloud for Customer SSI Server-Side Integration can be mass-deployed for the end users following one of the two main scenarios, depending on the Microsoft Exchange authentication type setting:\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**1.1** Authentication based on [Microsoft Exchange Impersonation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/exchange/client-developer/exchange-web-services/impersonation-and-ews-in-exchange) is a scenario where the local Exchange Admin configures an [impersonating service account](../Configure-Impersonation/) for a specific organization (group of users) entitled to use SAP Cloud for Customer SSI, and then this impersonating account is used to authorize SSI Sync access to their data. This is the recommended approach, since it doesn't require any actions from the end users to complete tool deployment  \n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**1.2** Authentication based on Microsoft Exchange Direct Logon (or Office 365 Oauth, or Google Direct Logon) is a scenario where general deployment is carried out by the local Admin, by setting up SAP Cloud for Customer SSI Add-In, but after that the users must log in to the Add-In and [enter their Microsoft Exchange/Office 365/Google credentials in its settings](../How-to-Configure-User/). This approach is less recommended and can be applied for smaller groups of users, since it requires additional actions from the end users to complete tool deployment\n\n&nbsp;\n\n* * *\n\n&nbsp;\n\n## 2\\. Admin deployment actions\n\n### &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;2.1 Prerequisites\n\nBefore starting SAP Cloud for Customer SSI deployment, the Admin must decide what mail server access authentication type will be used, [*Microsoft Exchange Impersonation*](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/exchange/client-developer/exchange-web-services/impersonation-and-ews-in-exchange) or *Microsoft Exchange Direct Logon* for MS Exchange, or *Office 365 OAuth* for Office 365, or *Google Direct Logon* for Gmail.\n\nIf *Microsoft Exchange Impersonation* (see point **1.1** above) is to be used, first an [impersonating service account must be configured](../Configure-Impersonation/) by the local MS Exchange admin for a group of end users' e-mail accounts entitled to use the tool. After that, proceed to the steps below.\n\nIf *Microsoft Exchange Direct Logon* (see point **1.2** above) is to be used, you may proceed directly to the steps below.  \n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;**2.1.1** Log in to SAP Cloud for Customer SSI using Admin account (Key User) credentials\n\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;**2.1.2** Go to **E-Mail Integration** (1) > **Groupware Settings** (2) page. Note that it is available exclusively for the local SAP Cloud for Customer Admin; regular users can access only the *User Settings*\n\n<!-- Do regular users not have access to Groupware Settings? -->\n\n![](..\\assets\\images\\Admin\\1.png)\n\n&nbsp;\n\n* * *\n\n&nbsp;\n\n### &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;2.2 Configuring user Profile settings\n\n!!! tip \"Tip\"\n    Also refer to [this article](../How-to-Open-Your-C4C-SSI-Settings-Profile/) for detailed information on SAP Cloud for Customer SSI Profiles configuration\n\nA SAP Cloud for Customer SSI Profile is a collection of configurable settings and parameters which define what functional patterns SSI for Microsoft Outlook follows for a specific set of users. It can be adjusted individually or in bulk to suit end users' needs better.\n\nProfile configuration steps *2.2.1 \u2013 2.2.4* can be skipped, if you intend to apply the *DEFAULT PROFILE TEMPLATE* for the Organization to be created. In this case all users within the same organization will obtain a default set of preferences and settings provided in the solution.\n\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;**2.2.1** On the *Groupware Settings* page, open the *Profiles* tab\n\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;**2.2.2** Find the *DEFAULT PROFILE TEMPLATE* item and click **Copy Default Profile Template**\n\n![](..\\assets\\images\\Admin\\2.png)\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;**2.2.3** Enter a *Profile name* and configure profile settings.

An Organization's name and settings can only be adjusted by the SAP Cloud for Customer Admin.\n\nThe Organization configuration step can be skipped, if the *DEFAULT ORGANIZATION* profile will be used. In this case all its users' Sync will be authorized to access Microsoft Exchange with the same authentication method and will share the same default Profile.\n\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;**2.3.1** On the *Groupware Settings* page, open the *Organizations* tab\n\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;**2.3.2** Click **New** to create a new Organization\n\n![](..\\assets\\images\\Admin\\7.png)\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;**2.3.3** Enter Organization name into the *Name* field and choose a *Profile* (the *DEFAULT PROFILE TEMPLATE* or the Profile that was specifically created for organization on the previous step)\n\nIn the *E-mail Configuration* section:\n\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;**a.** If *Microsoft Exchange Impersonation* access type was chosen:\n\n- Select this type in the *Mailbox Access Type* field\n- Enter the login credentials of the [impersonated Microsoft Exchange account](../Configure-Impersonation/) configured by your local Exchange Administrator\n- Enter your [Exchange Web Services (EWS) URL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/exchange/client-developer/exchange-web-services/explore-the-ews-managed-api-ews-and-web-services-in-exchange) provided by your local Exchange Admin. By default, the EWS URL is set to *https://**[your mail server's URL]**/EWS/Exchange.asmx*. The EWS URL can also be auto-discovered, by clicking the **Auto-discover** button in the same tab  \n\n&nbsp;\n\n!!! note \"Note\"\n    If *Microsoft Exchange Direct Logon* or *Office 365 OAuth* or *Google Direct Logon* access type is used, this deployment scenario implies that each end user will be required to enter one's Exchange mailbox credentials [manually in SAP Cloud for Customer SSI Sync settings](../How-to-Configure-User/)  \n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;**b.** If *Microsoft Exchange Direct Logon* access type was chosen, select it in the **Mailbox Access Type** field.
