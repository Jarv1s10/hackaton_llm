If your Org uses [Exchange Web Services](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/exchange/client-developer/exchange-web-services/start-using-web-services-in-exchange) to access email and calendar data, the local MS Exchange Admin should make certain configuration adjustments in order to make [Meeting Room lists](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/exchange/recipients/room-mailboxes?view=exchserver-2019) available in {{ product_name }}, e.g. to be used for {{ short_name }}'s' [Book me](../Sharing-Calendar-Availability-(Adaptive-view)/) and [Time Slots](../How-to-Send-Meeting-Time-Slots-(Adaptive-view)/) features.

!!! note "Note"
    If an [impersonating Service account](../Setting-Up-Impersonated-Access-and-Configuring-Mailbox-Access-for-Organizations-and-Users/) is used for[{{ company_name }} Sync users authorization](../Email-Integration-Full-Deployment-Scenarios/), the Service account must have a mailbox and an Office license assigned to it. If the Service Account does not have a mailbox or license assigned, rooms and resources will not be retrieved in room lists via EWS 

&nbsp;



Then you should configure Room lists, that can only be done via [PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/exchange/?view=exchange-ps) for both MS Exchange and Office 365. See [this article](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj984289(v=exchg.160).aspx) to learn how to connect to your Office 365 instance via PowerShell.

After you have connected it, follow the steps below:

1\. Create a [Member Room](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/exchange/add-distributiongroupmember?view=exchange-ps). Room resources can be created via <https://portal.office.com/adminportal/home#/ResourceMailbox> or via PowerShell. See [this Microsoft article](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/exchange/recipients/room-mailboxes?view=exchserver-2019) for more information  

**2\.** Enter the following cmdlet in PowerShell:  

   ``New-DistributionGroup -Name "{meeting room's name}" -OrganizationalUnit "{your Org's Exchange instance}/Users" -RoomList``

All created Rooms must be included into this list.  

**3\.** Enter another cmdlet in PowerShell:  

â€‹    ``Add-DistributionGroupMember -Identity "{meeting room's name}" -Member Room#``

**4\.** Repeat the step **3** for every room that should be added  

&nbsp;

All meeting Rooms configured this way will become available in {{ product_name }} after the users [re-login into the Add-In](../How-to-Install-and-Run-the-Solution-all-configurations/#ii_rg_email_sidebar_logon)

#### Troubleshooting Resources Availability Over EWS

In case the rooms or other resources are still unavailable in {{ product_name }}, you can troubleshoot the configuration using a free and safe open-source tool [EWS Editor](https://github.com/dseph/EwsEditor/releases/tag/1.21).

**1\.** Connect to your Exchange server via EWS Editor See [this article](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/exchange/how-to-troubleshoot-ews-connection-issues-using-ews-editor/m-p/1567393) to learn how to do that

**2\.** Open **Tools** > **Meeting rooms...** or another resource category
