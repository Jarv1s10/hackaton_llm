The Share Calendar Availability (*Book me*) feature allows parsing your and your colleagues' availability periods based on Google calendar data to be sent to your business contacts, for example to negotiate a meeting time convenient for all participants involved or to schedule a series of meetings with different contacts. 

The unoccupied time slots from meeting organizer calendar(s) are parsed to be saved as a link to an interactive scheduling table webpage (Booking Confirmation page). 

When building availability tables without specified "Until" date on Book Me link creation page, {{ short_name }} shows the unoccupied time slots from calendar(s) over a 365 day span. This limit can be adjusted by request sent to [our CSM team](mailto:support@revenuegrid.com). 

&nbsp;

!!! tip "Tip"
    Also, see [this {{ company_name }} blog article](https://revenuegrid.com/blog/how-to-schedule-a-meeting-by-email/) for special insights about scheduling meetings via emails

&nbsp;

The organizer's and required in-org invitees' availability spans are parsed on Book Me link generation, and later if a another slot gets occupied that is also reflected on the [Booking page](../Sharing-Calendar-Availability-%28Adaptive-view%29/#how_to_book_a_slot_recipient_side) viewed by the recipient.  

As soon as a recipient clicks on their preferred slot, {{ product_name }} checks if the slot is still available in the organizer's and required in-Org attendees' calendars. In case it was occupied by another booking, the recipient is suggested to pick another slot. In addition, by refreshing Booking page browser window, the recipient can actualize the availability table after such checks.      


&nbsp;

Book Me links can be generated by the Add-In even if [{{ short_name }} Sync Engine](../Synchronization-Engine-An-Overview/) is not running; however, in this case, if any slot is booked, the resulting meetings won't be synced in the Salesforce calendar till [syncing is resumed](../Handling-Sync-Issues/).

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

### Fill in the general meeting parameters

**3\.** Fill in the general meeting details in the opened Book Me dialog:

<p>
    <img src="..\..\assets\images\Using-SmartCloud-Connect\How-To-s\Sharing-Calendar-Availability-(Adaptive-view)\bookme-general.png" style="width:47.09%; display:inline-block; vertical-align:middle; margin-left:1px;float: right;padding: 30px 0px">
</p>

* The **Meeting subject** field is prefilled with the subject of the related email (if any), and you can edit it if necessary

* In the **Location** field, you can select a location from your [MS Exchange rooms resources](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/exchange/recipients/room-mailboxes?view=exchserver-2019) or manually enter a location (including online services)

* In the **Duration**, you can select up to three different meeting slot durations that the Book Me link recipients may choose among on the resulting Booking page

* In the **Attendees (required)** field, you can add the participants whose presence is required at the meeting. It's prefilled with the email recipients. Also, you can add internal attendees who will receive the invite for this meeting once the link recipient books it

!!! note "Note"
    If you add any in-org attendees (they must belong to your MS Exchange space) in the **Attendees (required)** field, the resulting Booking page will show only the time slots that are available on all in-org attendees and organizer's calendars. This ensures that the selected slot will be convenient and available for all required in-org attendees

* In the **Attendees (optional)** field, you can add the participants, who will also receive the invite for this meeting once the link recipient books it, but as optional attendees. Note that optional attendees' calendars are disregarded on building availability table

<p>
    <img src="..\..\assets\images\Using-SmartCloud-Connect\How-To-s\Sharing-Calendar-Availability-(Adaptive-view)\description.png" style="width:39.9%; display:inline-block; vertical-align:middle; margin-left:1px;float: right; padding: 0px 5px">
</p>

* In the **Body (Description)** field (at the bottom of the Book Me dialog), you can add additional information for participants, which will be saved as a meeting description in the MS Exchange / Office 365 calendar and in Salesforce. This field is limited to 32k characters, if the description text is longer, it will be truncated to match this limit. Note that the generated email will not include this text in its body

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

### Link the meeting with Salesforce records

**4\.** Link the meeting with the [Salesforce Business and People records](https://www.sfdcpoint.com/salesforce/difference-between-whoid-and-whatid/):

<p>
    <img src="..\..\assets\images\Using-SmartCloud-Connect\How-To-s\Sharing-Calendar-Availability-(Adaptive-view)\bookme-linked.png" style="width:42.33%; display:inline-block; vertical-align:middle; margin-left:1px;float: right;padding: 30px 0px">
</p>

* In the **Save to Salesforce record** search box, you can find and select a Business record (Account, Opportunity etc.), which will be linked with the resulting Salesforce event once the link recipient books a meeting

* In the **Save to Lead or Contact** search box, you can find and select a People record, which will be linked with the resulting Salesforce event once the link recipient books a meeting

!!! note "Note"
    If you faced a situation when the booked meeting had linked to the wrong Contact in Salesforce, refer to [this article](../events-linked-to-wrong-contact/) describing how to resolve the problem and prevent it in the future

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

### Then fill in the optional meeting parameters hidden under the *Advanced options* tab

!!! tip "Tip"
    <p>
        <img src="..\..\assets\images\Using-SmartCloud-Connect\How-To-s\Sharing-Calendar-Availability-(Adaptive-view)\collapse-advanced.gif" style="width:42.98%; display:inline-block; vertical-align:middle; margin-left:1px;float: right; padding: 5px">
    </p>
    If you don't need the Advanced fields and controls in the Book Me dialog, click the **v** (collapse) icon next to the **Advanced options** section title to hide them

&nbsp;

**5\.** Fill in the Advanced meeting details to customize the calendar availability according to your needs:

<p>
    <img src="..\..\assets\images\Using-SmartCloud-Connect\How-To-s\Sharing-Calendar-Availability-(Adaptive-view)\inviting.png" style="width:41.27%; display:inline-block; vertical-align:middle; margin-left:1px;float: right;padding: 10px 5px">
</p>

* Select the **Allow inviting guests** checkbox to allow recipients of the generated Book Me link to invite extra guests as optional attendees. Recipient can add up to 10 guest emails on the Booking page

<p>
    <img src="..\..\assets\images\Using-SmartCloud-Connect\How-To-s\Sharing-Calendar-Availability-(Adaptive-view)\buffer.png" style="width:41.27%; display:inline-block; vertical-align:middle; margin-left:1px;float: right;padding: 10px 5px">
</p>

* **Time buffer b/w meetings** allows you to set a gap between consecutive meetings booked by different recipients via the Book Me link, so you can prepare for the next meeting or have a break

<p>
    <img src="..\..\assets\images\Using-SmartCloud-Connect\How-To-s\Sharing-Calendar-Availability-(Adaptive-view)\reminder.png" style="width:41.27%; display:inline-block; vertical-align:middle; margin-left:1px;float: right;padding: 5px 5px">
</p>

* Using the **Reminder** field, you can enable and set an [MS Outlook reminder](http://support.office.com/en-us/article/set-or-remove-reminders-7a992377-ca93-4ddd-a711-851ef3597925) in your Outlook calendar to notify you before the meeting starts

<p>
    <img src="..\..\assets\images\Using-SmartCloud-Connect\How-To-s\Sharing-Calendar-Availability-(Adaptive-view)\span-bw.png" style="width:41.27%; display:inline-block; vertical-align:middle; margin-left:1px;float: right;padding: 10px 5px">
</p>

* Using the **Minimal span between booking & actual start** field, you can set from 30 minutes up to 7 days span to ensure that you will have enough time to get prepared for the meeting after a slot is picked by Book Me link recipient

<p>
    <img src="..\..\assets\images\Using-SmartCloud-Connect\How-To-s\Sharing-Calendar-Availability-(Adaptive-view)\disregard.png" style="width:41.27%; display:inline-block; vertical-align:middle; margin-left:1px;float: right;padding: 10px 5px">
</p>

* Select the **Disregard organizer's calendar** to allow recipients of the generated Book Me link to book meetings on the occupied slots of your (organizer's) calendar. Note that if this parameter is enabled, your (organizer's) status on the booked meetings will be shown as **Free**. This feature is useful if you organize meetings for other people, where your participation is optional or not required.

&nbsp;

!!! tip "Tip"
    {{ short_name }} features an optional possibility to make the system treat Tentative slots as Busy instead of Free. This mechanics is managed Org-wide or for individual users, via the global setting *ShowTentativeAsBusy*. To enable this function refer to your Admin

&nbsp;

The advanced parameters described below allow you to set the calendar availability limits by selecting the weekdays, work hours, and dates range for generating available meeting slots on the Booking page. Adjust these limits to set the availability spans specific to your regular work schedule, for example if you are only available for meeting the customers on Mondays and Thursdays from 2:30pm until 5pm; in some scenarios you may also need to make these limits broader, for example if you want to arrange a Book Me meeting outside of your working hours or on a weekend.

<p>
    <img src="..\..\assets\images\Using-SmartCloud-Connect\How-To-s\Sharing-Calendar-Availability-(Adaptive-view)\availability.gif" style="width:41.27%; display:inline-block; vertical-align:middle; margin-left:8px;float: right;padding: 0px 5px">
</p>

* The **Available on (days of the week)** selection allows you to define the weekdays which will be available or unavailable for the meeting booking

* Using the **From** and **Until** drop-down lists, you can set the hours range that will be used for generating available slots to book the meeting

* The **From date** and **To date** calendar fields allow you to define the dates range that will be shown with the available slots on the Booking page. For example, you can use them for limited-time activities (conferences, field visits, business trips, etc.)

<br><br><br>

!!! note "Note"
    {{ short_name }} prefills the **Available on (days of the week)** selection and the **From** and **Until** down-drop lists with your [working days and time set in your MS Exchange / Office 365 account calendar settings](https://www.officetooltips.com/outlook_2016/tips/how_to_change_working_days_and_time_in_the_outlook_calendar.html). Also, you can adjust the prefilled values using the [Book Me defaults](#managing_book_me_defaults) feature without changing the work time in your Microsoft account
    
&nbsp;

&nbsp;

### Generate and insert the Book Me link

Once all necessary fields in Book Me dialog are filled in, {{ product_name }} is ready to generate a short link to a Booking web page with a table showing the available time slots based on your calendar data, your colleagues' (if any) calendar data, and other specified parameters.

&nbsp;

<p>
    <img src="..\..\assets\images\Using-SmartCloud-Connect\How-To-s\Sharing-Calendar-Availability-(Adaptive-view)\insert.png" style="width:39.42%; display:inline-block; vertical-align:middle; margin-left:10px;float: right;padding: 0px 0px">
</p>

**6\.** Click **Insert** in the upper right corner of the dialog, and the link will be automatically inserted into the new email message

<p>
    <img src="../../assets/images/Using-SmartCloud-Connect/How-To-s/Sharing-Calendar-Availability-(Adaptive-view)/availability_link.png">
</p>

&nbsp;

Now, you can add other information to the email containing the Book Me link and send it to the recipients, so they can select a convenient day and time and book a meeting with you.

!!! tip "Tip"
    Also, the generated Book Me hyperlinks can be inserted in any words, phrases, or sentences highlighted by the user in composed email's body. This feature works in MS Outlook for Windows or Mac and Outlook on the Web; [{{ short_name }} Web (Cloud) implementation](../Desktop-MSI-and-Cloud-Web-Implementations-Comparison/) only

&nbsp;

!!! warning "Important"
    Please note that when you are using this feature from the Sidebar running in MS Outlook [on a mobile device](../Using-on-iPhone/), you will not be able to edit the text of the resulting email – a pre-configured [Salesforce message template](https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=email_templates_lightning_parent.htm&type=5) will be used instead, and the email with the link you generated will be sent out by the Add-In automatically. 

&nbsp;

!!! tip "Tip"
    If you want to set a custom share calendar availability message template, refer to [this article](../Using-Salesforce-Templates/#custom_meeting_scheduler_templates)

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

* * *

&nbsp;

## The Book Me dialog default parameters

In the Book Me dialog, {{ product_name }} prefills some fields with the default values, the data retrieved from the selected email (if any), and your MS Exchange / Office 365 account. The following fields are prefilled with default values:

* *Meeting subject* – the subject of the selected or opened email when the Book Me icon is clicked in the Sidebar

* *Duration* – 30 minutes

* *Attendees (required)* – recipients from the *To* field of the selected or opened email when the Book Me icon is clicked

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

### Managing Book Me defaults

Also, using the **Book Me defaults** feature, you can set custom values that would be prefilled every time you open the Book Me dialog in {{ product_name }}.

<p>
    <img src="..\..\assets\images\Using-SmartCloud-Connect\How-To-s\Sharing-Calendar-Availability-(Adaptive-view)\manage-defaults.png" style="width:41.27%; display:inline-block; vertical-align:middle; margin-left:1px;float: right;padding: 5px 5px">
</p>

To open the **Book Me defaults** page, open {{ product_name }}, click the **Book Me** icon in the Smart Actions bottom toolbar, and click **Manage defaults** at the bottom of the Book Me dialog.

&nbsp;

On the opened *Book Me defaults* page, you can manage the default values for the **General** and **Advanced** options:

* In the **General** section, you can set the defaults for *Meeting subject format*, *Meeting subject*, *Location*, *Duration*, *Time buffer b/w meetings*, *Attendees (required)*, *Attendees (optional)*, and *Body (Description)*

<p>
    <img src="..\..\assets\images\Using-SmartCloud-Connect\How-To-s\Sharing-Calendar-Availability-(Adaptive-view)\defaults-general.png">
</p>

&nbsp;

* In the **Advanced** section, you can set the defaults for *Reminder*, *Minimal span between booking & actual start*, *Maximum allowed events per day for this type of event*, *Available on (days of the week)*, *From* and *Until* time range, *Allow inviting guests*, and *Disregard organizer's calendar* parameters

<p>
    <img src="..\..\assets\images\Using-SmartCloud-Connect\How-To-s\Sharing-Calendar-Availability-(Adaptive-view)\defaults-advanced.png">
</p>

&nbsp;

<p>
    <img src="..\..\assets\images\Using-SmartCloud-Connect\How-To-s\Sharing-Calendar-Availability-(Adaptive-view)\defaults-save.png" style="width:37.04%; display:inline-block; vertical-align:middle; margin-left:1px;float: right;padding: 0px 0px">
</p>

Once you customize the Book Me defaults according to your preferences, click **Save** and refresh {{ product_name }} to apply the changes.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

## How to Book a Slot (Recipient Side)

!!! note "Note"
    The Booking page language is set based on the locale specified in the web browser of the Book Me link recipient

&nbsp;

When the recipient opens the Book Me link, they can select the time slot by clicking on the preferred date and time. The time zone of the generated Booking page will be pre-set for each recipient based on their email client data. Also, they can select a specific time zone using the drop-down list above the list of available time slots.

<p>
    <img src="..\..\assets\images\Using-SmartCloud-Connect\How-To-s\Sharing-Calendar-Availability-(Adaptive-view)\booking-page1.png" class="minimized">
</p>

&nbsp;

!!! note "Note"
    When a recipient clicks on the preferred slot, {{ product_name }} checks if it is still available in the organizer and in-org required attendees' calendars. In case it is occupied, {{ short_name }} suggests recipient to selecr another time slot. Also, the recipient can actualize information about available slots by refreshing the Booking page

&nbsp;

After recipient selects a slot on the Booking page, they also need to fill in their *Full name* and *Email* address in the *Booking Confirmation* dialog and click the **Book meeting** button.

<p>
    <img src="..\..\assets\images\Using-SmartCloud-Connect\How-To-s\Sharing-Calendar-Availability-(Adaptive-view)\booking-page2.png" class="minimized">
</p>

&nbsp;

As soon as a slot is selected and booked by the recipient, it gets automatically reserved in your calendar, and you receive a corresponding notification.

!!! note "Note"
    To prevent calendar spamming activities via the Book Me link, a [standard reCAPTCHA v3 anti-bot check](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/intro/v3.html) is implemented on the Booking page

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

### The Extra Fields: Phone Number and Notes

The Booking page also includes the optional fields *Phone number* and *Notes*. T These fields allow meeting attendees to share their phone numbers with the Organizer and other participants for direct connection or providing extra details prior to the meeting.

<p>
    <img src="..\..\assets\images\Using-SmartCloud-Connect\How-To-s\Sharing-Calendar-Availability-(Adaptive-view)\extra-fields.png">
</p>
    
!!! warning "Important"
    Since entered *Phone number* and *Notes* get appended to the meeting’s *Description*, they also get conveyed to **all** required and optional meeting invitees. For this reason, the recipients should always consider the privacy requirements for the *Phone number* sharing and what information can be listed in meeting *Notes*

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

## Quick Send Availability

<p>
    <img src="..\..\assets\images\Using-SmartCloud-Connect\How-To-s\Sharing-Calendar-Availability-(Adaptive-view)\quick-send-availability.png" style="width:39.29%; display:inline-block; vertical-align:middle; margin-left:1px;float: right;padding: 0px 0px">
</p>

Besides the Book Me feature, you can use the **Quick Send Availability** shortcut located in MS Outlook ribbon to quickly send your availability slots omitting several steps.

&nbsp;

After you click this button, the link to the availability selection page will immediately be inserted into the email message.

!!! tip "Tip"
    Quick Send Availability also respects the defaults set on the [Book Me defaults](#managing_book_me_defaults) page, so all of them will be used when you generate a link via the *Quick Send Availability* button

<!-- (need to check if this tip is still valid)
!!! tip "Tip"
    In the latest {{ product_name }} updates it is possible to set the default (prefilled) Meeting Location and Duration, which will also be preset for links generated with Quick Send Availability. To set the default Meeting Location and Duration to be used, submit a corresponding request to [our CSM team](mailto:support@revenuegrid.com)
-->

&nbsp;

!!! warning "Important"
    Please note that when you use this feature from the Sidebar running in MS Outlook [on a mobile device](../Using-on-iPhone/), you will not be able to edit the text of the resulting email – a preconfigured [Salesforce message template](https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=email_templates_lightning_parent.htm&type=5) will be used instead, and the email with the link you generated will be sent out by the Add-In automatically

## Calendar slots Status parsing by Meeting Scheduler

When {{ short_name }} parses occupied slots data from the users' MS Exchange / Office 365 calendar, it applies the following rules to interpret the slots' specific statuses. Keep in mind that this data is **not** parsed continuously in real time, instead, it is a "snapshot" of your calendar at the time when the meeting was initiated with {{ short_name }} Meeting Scheduler.

&nbsp;

| Slot status in MS Outlook                    | Slot status in Meeting Scheduler tables |
| -------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |

!!! tip "Tip"
    {{ short_name }} features an optional possibility to make the system treat Tentative slots as Busy instead of Free. This mechanics is managed Org-wide or for individual users, via the global setting *ShowTentativeAsBusy*. To enable this function refer to your Admin

## MS Teams integration on Location selection

The customers may request [our Support team](mailto:support@revenuegrid.com) to enable a special MS Teams integration option that allows {{ product_name }} users to automatically generate [MS Teams meeting rooms links](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/rooms/) for meetings created with {{ short_name }} Time Slots and Book Me features. This option is available for Office 365 mailboxes, via [MS Graph](../MS-Graph/) or hybrid MS Graph-[EWS](../Working-With-EWS/) connectivity: the [Add-In](../AddIn-vs-Sync-Functions/) works via Graph and [Sync Engine](../AddIn-vs-Sync-Functions/) works via EWS.

&nbsp;

To generate and send an MS Teams meeting link, once the feature was configured by our Support team or [the local Admin](../How-to-Log-In-to-the-Admin-Panel/):

</p>

**1\.** In the Book Me creation dialog, click the **Location** field and enter *MS Teams* (or another custom name configured for your Org) or select this item on the top of the picklist   

&nbsp;

**2\.** Complete Book Me link generation process and send it to the recipient(s)

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

### Special considerations for using MS Teams integration

- In order to open the MS Teams meeting link generated this way, the recipient does **not** have to belong to your Organization, but must have MS Teams running   

- A new unique MS Teams meeting room link is generated for every meeting. Several invitees from inside or outside of your company can join the meeting by opening the MS Teams link   

- Note that the MS Teams meeting link is **not** included in the Book Me email or selection table; instead, it will be added to the MS Outlook meeting created in the recipient's Calendar

!!! tip "Tip"
    To make sure that the recipients do not lose the link, it is recommended to mention in invite email's body that the link for joining the meeting will be available in the meeting's Description on the recipients' MS Outlook calendar as soon as they book the meeting

## How to invalidate a compromised Book Me link

!!! note "Note"
    By default generated share availability (Book Me) links expire 365 days after their creation date. This period can be adjusted [on request sent to our CSM team](mailto:support@revenuegrid.com)

See [this article](../Invalidate-Book-Me/) to learn how to invalidate a Book Me link if a recipient misuses it for calendar spamming.

&nbsp;

## Shared Calendars compatibility

The Book Me and Time Slots features are fully compatible with [MS Exchange / Office 365 Shared calendar](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook/troubleshoot/calendaring/how-to-share-calendar-and-contacts) use scenarios. Different users viewing a shared calendar can initiate {{ short_name }} Meeting Scheduler meetings assigned to it by following [the same steps](#to_initiate_a_meeting_by_sharing_your_availability_periods_with_business_contacts), with a single addition, you should specify what calendar you are generating the link for:

<p>
    <img src="..\..\assets\images\Using-SmartCloud-Connect\How-To-s\How-to-Send-Meeting-Time-Slots-(Adaptive-view)\bookme-shared-select.png">
</p>

&nbsp;

A Book Me / Time Slots meeting can be created in a shared calendar even if the calendar's account does not have the [{{ short_name }} Add-In](../Introduction/) or [Sync Engine](../Synchronization-Engine-An-Overview/) configured, but in the latter case the resulting meeting will **not** get synced to Salesforce.
