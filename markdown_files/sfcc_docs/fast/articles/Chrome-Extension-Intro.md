{{ short_name }} for Salesforce and Gmail works with both Gmail and [GSuite](https://workspace.google.com/).

{{ product_name }} for Salesforce ensures seamless integration between Salesforce and your Gmail mailbox/Google Calendar. After [adding the {{ product_name }} Extension to Google Chrome](../How-to-Set-Up-the-Chrome-Extension-for-Salesforce-and-Gmail/), you will be able to unfold all power of Salesforce right from your Gmail box:

*   Instantly [get access to the Salesforce records](../Initial-Search-and-Applied-Record-Filters/#related_records_retrieval_pattern) that are relevant to your currently opened email message/calendar events
*   [Create new or search for existing Salesforce records](../Searching-for-Existing-Salesforce-Records-and-Creating-New-Records-(Adaptive-view)/) right from your Gmail mailbox
*   [Save emails](../Saving-Emails-in-Salesforce-2.-Ways-to-Save-an-Email-(Adaptive-view)/) and [email attachments](../Attachments-Handling-(Basic)/) from Gmail to Salesforce
*   [Create new or edit existing](../Managing-Tasks-(Classic-view)/) Salesforce tasks
*   [Synchronize Google Calendar events](../Using-the-Solution-for-Salesforce-and-Gmail/#saving_emails_in_salesforce) with Salesforce
*   [Synchronize your Google Contacts](../Using-the-Solution-for-Salesforce-and-Gmail/#syncing_contacts_between_gmail_and_salesforce) with Salesforce
*   Use the Salesforce collaboration tool [Chatter](../Using-Chatter/)
*   [Customize](../Customization-Settings-Explained/) the {{ product_name }} for Salesforce Extension's settings

!!! note "Note"
    Besides your emails {{ product_name }} works with your [Google Calendar](https://workspace.google.com/learning-center/products/calendar/get-started/#!/) and [Google Contacts](https://workspace.google.com/learning-center/products/contacts/get-started/#!/) data in order to [synchronize](../Synchronization-Engine-An-Overview/) your business email correspondence, scheduled business events, and selected business contacts with your Salesforce account. Note that this two-sided data transfer performed by {{ product_name }} is ruled by the principles of [privacy and security](../Privacy-and-Security/); the data is not stored or shared outside of {{ short_name }} secured infrastructure and is transferred directly between Google and Salesforce over [secure Microsoft Azure servers](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security/azure-security)
&nbsp;  

!!! note "Note"
    {{ product_name }} supports [Gmail / Google Workspace email alliases](../MS-Exchange-Aliases-Handling/). {{ short_name }} ensures their recognition, seamless processing of the relevant data and synchronization with Salesforce

### The Extension's system requirements

{{ product_name }} for Salesforce and Gmail is **not** a standalone application, it only works in Gmail's web interface opened in Google Chrome or a Chromium-based browser or a browser based on [Chromium engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromium_(web_browser)). It is as cross-platform as the Chrome browser itself, so you can use it in Windows 7 and later, MacOS 10.10 and later, Android KitKat and later, iOS 11 and later, Linux, Chrome OS.

You can effectively run it on tablet devices, but please note that the Extension's rendering is not specifically optimized for using it on mobile phone screens.

The prerequisites to use the {{ short_name }} Chrome Extension for Salesforce and Gmail:

- The latest update of Google Chrome or a Chromium based browser available for your Operating System
- A corporate Gmail / Google Workspace (G Suite) account
- A Salesforce account
- Internet connection
