An essential communication automation feature offered by Revenue Grid (RG) is managing campaign Sequences in efficient conjunction with registering all activities and status changes in Salesforce.<br><br>

RE Sequence is a series of communication steps (actions) performed by a Revenue Grid end user to engage and nurture Leads and Contacts retrieved from your Salesforce, delivering campaign information and collecting their responses via different channels. The steps follow a specific flow set by RG users; both inbound and outbound email communication within a Sequence is automatically registered in Salesforce.<br><br>

Several consequential Sequences can be used in communication with the same group of prospects. For example, after an initial engagement Sequence is successful with a prospect, you can switch this prospect to a different Sequence for further nurturing.  <br><br>
Another related application of email Sequences, product or service sales can be followed up by use satisfaction and other kinds of surveys or product update notifications via secondary RG Sequences.
