#### Prospect contacts and details

The detailed prospect card includes the following information: 

- The <a href="../Prospect-Statuses/">prospect's status</a> 
- Indicator if a prospect saved in Salesforce as Lead, Contact, or other:<br>
<p style="margin-left:2%;">
<img src="../../assets/images/People/lead.svg" style="display: inline-block;vertical-align: middle;width: 30px;margin-left: 1px;height: 30px;object-fit: contain;"> Prospect linked to Salesforce Lead<br><br>
<img src="../../assets/images/People/contact.svg" style="display: inline-block;vertical-align: middle;width: 30px;margin-left: 1px;height: 30px;object-fit: contain;"> Prospect linked to Salesforce Contact<br><br>
**No icon** - Prospect has been <a href="../import-recipients-from-csv/">imported from a CSV file</a> directly to Revenue Grid or added  manually as a single record using the <a href="../Recipients/#where_i_can_add_recipients_from">Add a new prospect</a> button. The prospect is not linked to any Salesforce record
 </p>
- Company name, contact information (email, phone number)  
- The date and time when the prospect was last contacted  
- Engagement statistics for the prospect: number of calls made, emails sent, emails opened (with help of built-in Revenue Grid email tracker), link clicks, and replies received.

#### How to find out in what sequences a prospect has been so far?

<p> <img src="../../assets/images/08052021/activity_pane.png" style="margin-left:15px;  float: right; width: 40%; height: 40%;">
The right-hand side pane shows a timestamped communication and event log in chronological order happened with a prospect. <br><br>
Important events (e.g. for example <a href="../Sequences-Stages/">prospect's stage</a> change, <a href="../to-dos/#owner_change">Owner Change</a>, <a href="../to-dos/#lead_conversion">Lead Conversion</a>) which happen to a prospect during the life cycle within Revenue Grid, can be identified by the icons. <br><br>
The very first record on the History Feed is always date of import to Revenue Grid and user name of the employee who has done the import. <br><br>
Every Sequence-related record in the History feed has number of Step for easier engagement analytics.
