Every reply to your outreach from a recipient will end up on the Replies tab for you to process it manually. Until you process what to do with a reply, the recipient will not be proceeded to the next step of a Sequence, in order to avoid confusion. You may Reply to a recipient and Finish a Sequence for him/her, or Finish right away and specify on what [stage](../Sequences-Stages/) a prospect is within the sequence: Not interested, Success or Opt-out.

#### Reply and Finish

This will open a message editor so you can edit subject, as well as type and customize your reply message. Make sure you use handy toolbar to customize your reply, where among other things you may:

![](../assets/images/Planner/reply-template.png)

- Add CC recipients

- Add a pre-made [email template](../Templates/) from the drop-down instead of typing a message here

- Use <img src="../../assets/images/Planner/insert-url.png" style="display: inline-block;vertical-align: middle;width: 24px;margin-left: 1px;height: 24px;object-fit: contain;"> to insert links

- Add an inline image by pasting it from clipboard or by inserting through <img src="../../assets/images/Steps/inline.png" style="display: inline-block;vertical-align: middle;width: 24px;margin-left: 1px;height: 24px;object-fit: contain;"> button on the toolbar. You may include an image from your local computer or from the Web by pasting in a link

- Add an attachment to your message using  <img src="../../assets/images/Steps/attach.png" style="display: inline-block;vertical-align: middle;width: 24px;margin-left: 1px;height: 24px;object-fit: contain;"> button on the bar. These are file types which you can attach:  pdf, doc, docx, xls, xlsx, ppt, pptx, csv, txt, rtf, ods, odt, html, zip, 7z, rar,  mp3, mp4, wma, mpg, flv, avi, jpg, jpeg, png, gif, epub, fb2 

- Preview how your email will look for a recipient

<div  class="admonition tip">
<p class="admonition-title">Send me a test email</p>
<p>You can always send yourself an email you are preparing for a prospect, just to eyeball how a prospect will see on the other end. Click the more options icon <img src="../../assets/images/Sequences/moreactions.png" style="display: inline-block;vertical-align: middle;width: 30px;margin-left: 1px;height: 30px;object-fit: contain;">, and then "Send me a test email</p>
<img src="../../assets/images/Planner/endtestemail.png" style="width: 100%; height: 100%;"/>

</div>

  <br>

After you are done with building a reply message, you have options to choose from:

1. Send the message and finish the sequence for this particular recipient by changing his/her [stage within the sequence](../Sequences-Stages/) to: Not interested, Success or Opt out

4. or Discard the reply

#### Just Finish

In case if you don't want to reply to a recipient, simply *finish* the sequence for this particular recipient by changing his/her [stage within the sequence](../Sequences-Stages/) to: Not interested, Success or Opt out.
