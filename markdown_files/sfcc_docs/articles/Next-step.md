<p> <img src="../../assets/images/Sequences/next-step.png" style="margin-left:15px;  float: right; width: 25%; height: 25%;">
Here is the list of possible values of Next Steps of a sequence. 
<br>
</p>
<p style="margin-left:2%;">
• No step - means either a prospect has been finished within the sequence, or the sequence hasn't been activated yet.
<br><br>
• Paused for this Person - There are several reasons listed below which may put a progress of a recipient within a sequence	on hold. See below.
<br><br>
• Details of the next scheduled Step: Number of step and day; Automatic vs Draft; and scheduled time.
<br><br><br><br>
</p>

## Reasons why a sequence can be on pause for a prospect

<p style="margin-left:6%;">
⚠️ Received a reply from a prospect to one of email type of steps. Those will be on the <a href="../Replies/">replies</a> tab for you to choose how to process them
<br><br>
⚠️ Received a reply from a prospect's colleague. A corresponding <a href="../to-dos/">To-do</a> item will be in the Action Center for you to choose what action to take next
<br><br>
⚠️ Broken <a href="../Using-Merge-Fields/">merge field</a> in your message will also put a sequence for a prospect on pause. A corresponding <a href="../to-dos/">To-do</a> item will be in the Action Center for you to fix it either by removing *Merge Field* from your message, or by filling out required field directly in Salesforce
<br><br>
⚠️ Owner of a prospect has been changed in Salesforce. A corresponding <a href="../to-dos/">To-do</a> item will be in the Action Center for you to perform an action so a sequence proceeds
<br><br>
⚠️ You can manually pause a sequence for any of your recipients using <a href="../Recipients/#mass_and_single_prospect_actions">mass actions</a> or via the <a href="../Sidebar/#sequence_widget">Sidebar</a>
<br><br>
⚠️ Received a standalone email
<br><br>
⚠️ Received a meeting invite or meeting confirmation
<br><br>
⚠️ Lead has been converted to a Contact in Salesforce
</p>

<div class="admonition hint">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p style="margin-left:2%;">Except the case when you pause a sequence for a prospect manually, <i>Action Required</i> column on Audience page and <i>Sequence name</i>→Recipient's tab will have a call to action to resolve the reason why is it on pause.</p>

## Special indicators

<p><img src="../../assets/images/Sequences/specind.png" style="margin-left:15px;  float: right; width: 40%; height: 40%;"/>
There are two special indicators appear in the column.<br><br>
The red info icon appears when the next step has not been sent out because <a href="../Settings/#limits">email bandwidth limits</a> had been hit. In such cases, Revenue Grid recalculates the next available time and date considering the sequence's delivery schedule. <a href="../Settings/#limits">email bandwidth limits</a>
<br><br>
The pen icon is a control for you to reschedule the next step to any other date. Hover on to the area, click the icon and select the new date.
