I’d like to speak with someone from &lcub;&lcub;Company&rcub;&rcub; who is responsible for [handling something that's relevant to my product].
<br><br>
If that’s you, are you open to a fifteen-minute call on &lcub;&lcub;weekdays_from_now 2&rcub;&rcub; or &lcub;&lcub;weekdays_from_now 3&rcub;&rcub; to discuss ways the &lcub;&lcub;Sender Company Name&rcub;&rcub; platform can specifically help your business? If not you, can you please put me in touch with the right person?
<br><br>
I appreciate the help!
<br><br>
Best,

Hasn’t our communication been fun?! - me, writing to you now and then; you, not responding… Perhaps, the stars simply didn’t align. Yeah, I definitely blame them, little shiny brats.
<br><br>
Fun as it is, though, I want to tell you goodbye now and wish all the best to you. My understanding is that at the moment you might not be interested in (your solution) for &lcub;&lcub;Company&rcub;&rcub;, however beneficial it may be.
<br><br>
Still, if you ever need one, I’ll be happy to hear from you any time.
<br><br>
Plus I would really appreciate it if you can provide me little feedback on why (your solution) is not suitable for &lcub;&lcub;Company&rcub;&rcub;?
<br><br>
So, best wishes to you and lots of success to &lcub;&lcub;Company&rcub;&rcub;.
