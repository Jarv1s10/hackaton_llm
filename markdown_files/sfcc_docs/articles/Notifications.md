##Types of notifications:

####Standalone emails
<p> <img src="../../assets/images/Planner/dismissreply2.png" style="margin-left:15px;  float: right; width: 355px; height: 155px;">
You can receive standalone emails from contacts who are currently active in at least one of your sequences. Those emails will appear on <i>Notifications tab</i> and you may <i>Reply</i> or <i>Dismiss</i> them.
</p>

If you choose to <i>Reply</i>, then type a response in the opened editor and send it, otherwise <i>Discard</i>.

<p style="margin-left:2%;">
You may add/edit CC recipients, choose a reply from <a href="../Templates/">a premade template</a>, create a sophisticated message using handy toolbar which has options like:</p>

<p style="margin-left:4%;">
- Inserting links by using <img src="../../assets/images/Planner/insert-url.png" style="display: inline-block;vertical-align: middle;width: 24px;margin-left: 1px;height: 24px;object-fit: contain;"> button on the bar. Remember that you are able to track if a recipient clicks on your links or not, very valuable insight. <br>
- Pasting an inline image from clipboard or add it using  <img src="../../assets/images/Steps/inline.png" style="display: inline-block;vertical-align: middle;width: 24px;margin-left: 1px;height: 24px;object-fit: contain;"> button on the bar. You may include an image from your local computer or from the Web by pasting in a link. <br>
- Adding an attachment to your message using  <img src="../../assets/images/Steps/attach.png" style="display: inline-block;vertical-align: middle;width: 24px;margin-left: 1px;height: 24px;object-fit: contain;"> button on the bar. These are file types which you can attach:  pdf, doc, docx, xls, xlsx, ppt, pptx, csv, txt, rtf, ods, odt, html, zip, 7z, rar,  mp3, mp4, wma, mpg, flv, avi, jpg, jpeg, png, gif, epub, fb2 
</p>

<br>

####Autoreplies
<p style="margin-left:0%;">
Another type of an item on Notifications tab is Auto-reply. Say your recipient is on a vacation and has turned on Automatic Reply feature. Revenue Grid places such responses here for you to process them manually. Options to process such response are, Reschedule a step to which auto-reply has been received with Pen icon, or simply <i>Continue</i> the sequence.
</p>

<br>

####Booked meeting
<p style="margin-left:0%;"> <img src="../../assets/images/06192022/6.png" style="margin-left:15px;  float: right; width: 40%; height: 40%;">
When a prospect accepts a meeting invitation, all sequences will be paused for that prospect. After the meeting you can handle such item by choosing how to continue engagement.
</p>
<br>
####Undelivered
<p style="margin-left:0%;">
This happens when an email address you have on file doesn't receive incoming emails. That may happen due to a typo when creating a contact in Salesforce, or email you are trying to reach doesn't exist anymore. A Lead/Contact's <a href="../Sequences-Stages/">stage within the sequence</a> and <a href="../Prospect-Statuses/">person status</a> gets marked as Bounced in Revenue Grid. You may finish a Sequence for him/her, then change email address and enroll the recipient into a sequence afresh. Click *Dismiss* to remove the notification from the Action Center

<p style="margin-left:0%;">
<b>Meeting invite response</b> - appears when a recipient sends you a meeting invite from his/her Exchange or Gmail email clients, or responses to your meeting invitation sent from your email or through <a href="https://docs.revenuegrid.com/ri/fast/articles/Sharing-Calendar-Availability-(Adaptive-view)/">Revenue Grid Email Sidebar Book Me functionality</a>. Following that, all sequences a recipient is enrolled into get paused for the recipient until resumed manually
