##What can be delegated between colleagues?

In Revenue Grid, you can allow selected colleagues to:<br>
<p style="margin-left:5%;">
1. Run <i>Sequences</i> on your behalf - meaning the selected delegates will be able to run <i>Sequences</i> which will send emails from your inbox (and send SMSs from a number assigned to you in Revenue Grid.)<br><br>
2. Be able to respond to prospects' <a href="../Replies/">replies</a> to Sequences' outreaches in the Action Center, and to finish Sequences for the prospects.<br><br>
3. Handle the delegated-Sequence's related <a href="../Replies/">Notification</a> and <a href="../to-dos/">To-dos</a>.

##Handling items generated by delegated-Sequences in the Action Center

<p> <img src="../../assets/images/Sequences/delegation1.png" style="margin-left:15px;  float: right; width: 40%; height: 40%;"> 
Handling such items are no different from handling regular <i>Sequences'</i> items. Though delegated-items are marked with a special green icon, so you are able to notice them.
