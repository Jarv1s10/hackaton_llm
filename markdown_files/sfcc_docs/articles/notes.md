Revenue Grid features a convenient way to leave notes about Opportunities to your team or to yourself. 

On the Opportunities page, you can leave two types of notes related to an Opportunity:  

* **Note** that are visible to all your colleagues. Only the author of the note can edit it and delete it.

* **Private note** that are visible only to you. Other team members wonâ€™t see it. 

Notes do not affect the score of Opportunities and do not appear in the Action Center, they are displayed only on the related Opportunity. Notes disappear from an Opp only if the author deletes it.
