An essential communication automation feature offered by Revenue Grid (RG) is managing sequences in efficient conjunction with registering all activities and status changes in Salesforce.<br><br>

A sequence is a series of communication steps (actions) a Revenue Grid end user performs to engage and nurture Leads and Contacts retrieved from their Salesforce, delivering campaign information and collecting responses via different channels. The sequence's steps follow a specific flow configured by RG users; both inbound and outbound email communication within a Sequence is automatically registered in Salesforce.<br><br>

Several consequential Sequences can be used in communication with the same group of prospects. For example, if an initial engagement sequence is successful with a prospect, you can switch this prospect to a different sequence for further nurturing.  <br><br>
Another related application of email Sequences is to follow up on product or service sales to measure user satisfaction or send out other kinds of surveys or product updates.
