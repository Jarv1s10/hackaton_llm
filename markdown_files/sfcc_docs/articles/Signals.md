###Signals types

### Signals with scores

Some signals may have a score to notify about any important event on the way to winning an Opportunity.
Any *signal with negative score* means a bad impact on winning a deal, while any *positive signal* means a push forward towards winning a deal. Upon receiving, the signal score adds up to the overall score of an Opportunity. 

Score of a **manually created signal** is 

<img src="../../assets/images/guided/dollar-normal.svg" style="display:inline-block; vertical-align:middle; margin:1px; object-fit:contain;"> **+3** for a positive signal

<img src="../../assets/images/guided/droplet-normal.svg" style="display:inline-block; vertical-align:middle; margin:1px; object-fit:contain;"> **-16** for a negative signal



The negative or positive score of **automatically generated signals** notifications is specified by an authorized employee on creating signals generation rule in <a href="../../ri/fast/articles/signals-settings-and-parameters/">Signals Builder</a>. 

&nbsp;

Depending on its total score, an Opportunity is assigned a color that visualizes how it's going: 

<img src="../../assets/images/guided/opp-score.png" style="margin-left:15px;  float: right; width: 50%; height: 40%;">

* **Green** (0+ ) – the Opportunity is healthy and is going well
* **Yellow** (from -1 to -30) – the Opportunity needs attention
* **Red** (-31 and less) – the Opportunity is at risk of being lost
