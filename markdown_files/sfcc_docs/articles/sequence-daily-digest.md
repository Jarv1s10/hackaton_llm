Daily sequences digest keeps you focused on what's important in regards to your automated Sequences that engage prospects.
<br><br>
It notifies you how many sequences are active and how many prospects in the sequences are stuck and need your attention immoderately.

<br>
#### Why are you receiving the Daily sequences digests?
Once you create a sequence, Revenue Grid starts sending you a daily digest to keep you in the loop.
<br>

<br>
#### How to interpret the data?
The number of the Action Center items indicates how many recipients are at the point where you have to take an action manually. Each Action Center item is related to a single prospect in your sequence.<br><br>

Items may include:
<p style="margin-left:2%;">
<a href="../Replies/">Replies from your prospects</a> <br>
<a href="../Notifications/">Notifications</a> <br>
<a href="../to-dos/">To-do items to ensure smooth outreach to a certain prospect</a> <br>
</p>

All these items are clickable, so you can conveniently open the necessary Action Center page and take the required actions.

!!! warning "Important"
    Unless you take the action to resolve each item separately, the corresponding prospect will **not** proceed within a sequence.

#### Running vs idling sequences

Running sequences are those <a href="../Create-new-sequence/#activate_the_sequence">which are activated</a>, whereas idling are inactive ones.
