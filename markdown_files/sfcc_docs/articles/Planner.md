The Action Center is the primary set of tabs, where you can monitor and manage your Signals and outcomes of the [Sequences](../Sequences/) you initiate. Here you receive replies to your automated emails, system notifications, To-Do tasks. Every item is logged in coherent chronological order as a node in the Sequence flow visualization.

#### Keep up with your active Sequences

To guarantee an interrupted execution of current steps, as well as shift from one step to the following, for every single recipient, make sure you process the action items in the Action Center asap.

What appears in the Action Center:
<br><br>

• <b>Replies from prospects</b> - Now you can <i>Finish</i> a sequence for the prospect even without a replying back. How to <a href="../Replies/#how_to_handle_replies">handle replies</a>.
<br><br>
• <b>Notifications</b>  - See the complete list of possible notification and how to act upon <a href="../Notifications/#types_of_notifications">here</a>.
<br><br>
• <b>To-Dos</b> - Actions required. see the complete list of possible to-dos <a href="../to-dos/#types_of_to-do_items">here</a>.

<p style="font-size:16px">Note that you can <b>not</b> use the Action Center page for continuous email communication like you would use an email box: through the Action Center you can only send emails to a prospect as email type of steps within an established sequence or reply to a standalone email from a prospect.</p>

Over time, you may have too many items in the Action Center. For faster navigation through, use: <br><br>

• the <b>Search</b> field, to search specific items by recipient's name, email or by subject of a message.<br><br>
• the <b>Filter by</b> drop-down to pick all items of a specific <a href="../Sequences/">Sequences</a>.<br><br>
• the <b>Filter by type and label</b> <img src="../../assets/images/Planner/type_filter.png" style="display: inline-block;vertical-align: middle;width: 25px;margin-left: 1px;height: 25px;object-fit: contain;"> to narrow down items shown in the Action Center. Types you can pick are: <i>Email drafts,Other email, Auto-reply, Bounce, Call, SMS, Misc. Label Colleague's reply, Owner change, Lead conversion, Sending failure, Field merge issue.</i>
<br><br>
To filter the Action Center only to past and due items, select <i>Past and due items</i> in the Filter drop-down.
