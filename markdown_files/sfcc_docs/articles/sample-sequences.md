Hasn’t our communication been fun?! - me, writing to you now and then; you, not responding… Perhaps, the stars simply didn’t align. Yeah, I definitely blame them, little shiny brats.
<br><br>
Fun as it is, though, I want to tell you goodbye now and wish all the best to you. My understanding is that at the moment you might not be interested in Guided Selling Solution for &lcub;&lcub;Company&rcub;&rcub;, however beneficial it may be.
<br><br>
Still, if you ever need one, I’ll be happy to hear from you any time.
<br><br>
Plus I would really appreciate it if you can provide me little feedback on why Revenue Grid is not suitable for &lcub;&lcub;Company&rcub;&rcub;?
<br><br>
So, best wishes to you and lots of success to &lcub;&lcub;Company&rcub;&rcub;.
