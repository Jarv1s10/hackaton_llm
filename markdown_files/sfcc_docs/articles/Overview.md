This tab is mainly for building/editing a series of outreaches called <b>Steps</b> in Revenue Grid. Step is a scheduled action to reach out a prospect. There is no limit how many Steps can a Sequence consist of. Once a Sequence is activated, added prospects (recipients) will start getting reached out starting from Step 1 in ascending order.<br><br>

###Clone, view to edit, and delete a step
<p> <img src="../../assets/images/08232021/clone-step.png" style="margin-left:15px;  float: right; width: 25%; height: 25%;">
Use <i>More option</i> menu on the right-hand side of a step to <b>clone, view to edit, or delete it</b>.
<br><br>
⚠️ Delete option is disabled if at least one recipient has ever been scheduled for the step.
</p>

## A/B testing

<p> <img src="../../assets/images/07272022/11.png" class="center" style="margin-left:5%; float: center;  width: 90%; height: 90%;">
A/B test different approaches and compare results. Create another up to 3 versions of a step, and recipients will be equally distributed among the versions.
<br><br>
Subject of the both versions stay the same.
<br><br>
For the integrity of <a href="../Analytics/">Statistics</a>, you cannot delete a version if at least one recipient has received it. Same applies to Steps in general as well. Pause it once you don't need it.
<br><br>
Click on the stat numbers to view the exact recipients who fell into the category. For example, to see who replied to the step, click on the <i>Replied</i> and you'll be redirected to <a href="../Recipients/">Recipients subtab</a> that will be filtered down to selected prospects.

## Quick stat of a Sequence

Stat of your sequence: Replied percentage; Total number of steps; Total number of days within which these steps are planned to get done from the first step to the last one; Percentage of steps which are automated and will be sent out without your intervention.

##Automatic vs Manual type of a step

<p><img src="../../assets/images/Sequences/automan.png" style="margin-left:15px;  float: right; width: 50%; height: 50%;"/>
How does each of these types work?<br><br>
Automatic steps get send out right on its schedule without user's manual review. It can be an Email or SMS type of a step. How do you make it automatic? Unselect the "Review and personalize this step" checkbox.
<br><br>
Whereas manual type of a step generates a separate To-do item per each recipient. To-do items appear in the Action Center.<br>
<br>

<div class="admonition hint">
<p class="admonition-danger">Important</p>
<p style="font-size:16px">Use with caution! Say you have 1000 recipients in a sequence and select the "Review and personalize this step" checkbox, then you will get 1000 To-do items every single one of which you will need to review and send out manually.</p>
