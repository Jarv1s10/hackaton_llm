### How we use information we collect   

How we use information we collect depends on what Services you use, how you use them, and on any preferences you may have communicated to us. Below are specific purposes of using information about you.   

\- To provide the Services and personalize user experience: We use information about you to provide the Services to you, including to transactions processing, Services login authentication, customer support provision, and Services operation and maintenance. Our Services also include tailored features that personalize your experience and enhance your productivity with our apps.   

\- For research and development: We constantly look for ways to make our Services smarter, faster, and more secure, integrated, useful to you. We use collective anonymized findings about how people use our Services as well as the feedback provided directly to us to troubleshoot issues and to identify products usage trends, activity patterns, and the areas for Services integration enhancing and general improvement. In some cases we apply these findings across different Services to improve and develop similar features or to better integrate them with other Services you use.

Besides that, we send you communications when you just start using to a particular Service to help you become more proficient with it.   

\- To market, promote, and drive engagement with the Services: We may use your contact information and the information about how you use the Services to send relevant promotional communication that may be of specific interest to you; that includes promotion emails and displaying targeted ads via other companies’ websites or apps, as well as via platforms like Facebook and Google. These communications include information about new features, survey requests, newsletters, and events that we think may be of interest to you and are aimed at boosting engagement and maximizing the Services’ value for you. We also notify customers about new products, offers, promotions, and contests.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Privacy Policy, our use of data obtained via the Google Restricted Scopes (hereinafter “Google User Data”) is limited to providing or improving user-facing features that are prominent in the requesting Service’s user interface. We do not use Google User Data for other purposes. We do not use or transfer Google User data for serving ads, including retargeting, personalized, or interest-based advertising.  App’s (Service’s) use of information received, and App’s (Service’s) transfer of information to any other app, from Google APIs will adhere to Google’s Limited Use Requirements.  Please, see the relevant subsection Product-Specific Privacy Terms in this Privacy Policy.    

Legal basis for processing (for EU and EEA users):   

If you are an individual in the European Economic Area (EEA), we collect and process information about you only when we have legal basis for doing so under applicable EU laws. The legal basis depends on the Services you use and how you use them. This means we collect and use your information only when we rely on one or more of the following grounds:   

- We need such information to provide the Services to you, including to operate the Services, provide customer support and personalized features and to protect the safety and security of the Services;   

- It satisfies a legitimate interest (which is not overridden by your data protection interests), such as for research and development, to market and promote the Services and to protect our legal rights and interests;   
- You give us consent to do so for a specific purpose; or   
- We need to process your data to comply with a legal obligation.   

If you have consented to our use of information about you for a specific purpose, you have the right to change your mind at any time, but this will not affect any processing that has already taken place. When we are using your information because we or a third party (e.g. your employer) have a legitimate interest to do so, you have the right to object to that use. However, in some cases, this may mean that you will no longer use the Services.   

### How we share information we collect 

We do not sell or trade your information with any third parties. 

This section describes how we may share data collected by us for the defined purposes and in accordance with a legal basis for processing, as specified in this Privacy Policy. 

 **Sharing with third parties**    

We share information with third parties that help us operate, provide, improve, integrate, customize, support, and market our services.    

Service providers: We engage our contracted service providers to provide website and application development, hosting, maintenance, backup, storage, virtual infrastructure, payment processing, analysis, and other services for us, which may require them to access or use information about you. If a service provider needs to access some information about you to perform relevant services on our behalf, they do so under strict instruction from us, including a set of Policies and Procedures implemented to protect your information.    

Third party apps: You, your administrator, or other Services users may choose to add new functionality or change the behavior of the Services by installing third-party apps within the Services. Doing so may give these third-party apps access to your account and information about you, like your name and email address, and any content you choose to use in connection with those apps. We encourage you to review privacy policies of third parties before connecting to or using their applications or services, to learn more about their privacy and information handling practices. If you object to information about you being shared with these third parties, please uninstall the app.    

Links to third party sites: The Services may include links that direct you to other websites or services whose privacy practices may differ from ours. If you submit information to any of those third party sites, your information is governed by privacy policies of these third party sites, and not by the present Policy. We encourage you to carefully read the privacy policy of any website you visit.    

With your consent: We may share information about you with third parties when you have given us your consent to do so. For example, we often display personal testimonials of satisfied customers on our public websites. With your consent, we may post your name by a testimonial.    

Compliance with Enforcement Requests and Applicable Laws; Enforcement of Our Rights: In exceptional circumstances, we may share information about you with a third party if we believe that sharing is reasonably necessary to (a) comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request, including to meet national security requirements, (b) enforce our Agreements, Policies and Terms of Service, (c) protect the security and integrity of our products and services, (d) protect Us, our customers or the public from harm or illegal activities, or (e) respond to an emergency which we believe in good faith requires us to disclose information to assist in preventing the death or serious bodily injury of any person.    

### How we store and secure information we collect   

**Security and storage of information**   

We use data hosting service providers located in the United States and Europe to host the information we collect and process, and we use industry standard technical measures to secure your data.   

We have taken steps to implement appropriate security, technical, and administrative measures to prevent unauthorized disclosure, use, or access to the information.   

 **How long we keep information**   

We will keep the Personal information we collect about you only for as long as we need it for the purposes it was collected, or for the period of time as may be required by law.    

How long we keep information we collect about you depends on the type of information, as described in further detail below. After such time, we will either delete or anonymize your information or, if this is not possible (for example, because the information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your information and isolate it from any further use until deletion is possible.   

Account information: We retain your account information for as long as your account is active and for a reasonable period thereafter, in case you decide to re-activate the Services. We also retain some of your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, to resolve disputes, to enforce our agreements, to support business operations, and to continue to develop and improve our Services. 

When we retain information for Service improvement and development, we take steps to eliminate information that directly identifies you, and we only use the information to uncover collective insights about the use of our Services, not to specifically analyze personal characteristics about you.   

Information you share on the Services: If your account is deactivated or disabled, some of your information and the content you have provided will remain.   

Managed accounts: If the Services are made available to you through an organization (e.g., your employer), we retain your information as long as required by the administrator of your account.   

Marketing information: If you have elected to receive marketing emails from us, we retain information about your marketing preferences for a reasonable period of time from the date you last expressed interest in our Services, such as when you last opened an email from us or stopped using your account at Our Services. We retain information derived from cookies and other tracking technologies for a reasonable period of time from the date such information was created.   

### INTERNATIONAL TRANSFER OF INFORMATION 

Your Personal Information may be processed by us in the United States, by our affiliates, and by our service providers including ones located in other countries, and as disclosed in the respective sections herein. 

In case your Personal Information is transferred outside EEA to any countries that are not subject to an adequacy decision by the European Commission, we ensure that the recipient provides the necessary adequate level of protection, as required by the GDPR (article 46), for example by entering into standard contractual clauses approved by the European Commission, if applicable; or you will be asked to give a prior written consent for such international transfer of your personal data, if that is required by law.  

**Privacy Shield**

We comply with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework, as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce (the “Privacy Shield”) regarding the collection, use and retention of personal information transferred from the European Union (EU) and Switzerland to the United States.

Should you have any Privacy Shield-related complaints about our collection or use of your personal information or any inquiries, please, contact Avora Holdings LTD at: privacy@revenuegrid.com. We will respond within 45 days.  

If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your complaint from us, or if we have not resolved your complaint, you may contact your relevant Data Protection Authority using the information provided at https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection_en and/or the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner (FDPIC). Avora Holdings LTD commits to cooperate with the panel established by the EU DPAs and/or the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner (FDPIC) and comply with the advice given by the panel established by the EU DPAs and/or FDPIC with regard to unresolved Privacy Shield complaints concerning data transferred from the EU and/or Switzerland.  

Under certain conditions, more fully described on the Privacy Shield website, you may be entitled to invoke binding arbitration through the Privacy Shield Panel if neither we nor the panel established by the DPAs/FDPIC resolves your Privacy Shield complaint.    

We are subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission.

[Revenue Inbox Meetings Scheduler](https://smartcloudconnect.io/docs/fast-channel/articles/How-to-Send-Meeting-Time-Slots-(Adaptive-view)/) temporarily keeps specified slots and spans to build selection tables for the recipients.
    *   Unlike Revenue Inbox, Revenue Grid has to store specific customer and communication data which is required for performing its sales engagement and communication automation functions: the users' email correspondence history and contacts imported from Salesforce are securely and discretely kept on Revenue Grid's MS Azure servers.
    *   No automatic Revenue Inbox customers opt-ins into Revenue Grid are performed; the customers must agree to the additional Revenue Grid Privacy Policy clauses before switching.  
    
*   Any personally identifiable information which gets transferred through our servers is secured with industry standard protocols and encryption technologies; more on this below.

### Confidentiality and Availability  

We implemented appropriate technical, organizational, and administrative systems, policies, and procedures designed to ensure the security, integrity, and confidentiality of customer data and to mitigate the risk of unauthorized access to or use of customer content.

Unless other terms apply or agreed otherwise, with respect to subscription based SaaS Services, during the prepaid subscription Revenue Grid will use commercially reasonable efforts to make the SaaS Services available 24 hours per day, 7 (seven) days per week, except for planned maintenance and emergency downtime and any unavailability due to circumstances out of Revenue Grid's control (including but not limited to customer's misuse of the Services; failures of customer's or its users' internet connectivity; Internet or other network traffic problems etc.).

&nbsp;

### Security Policies

With over 13 years of experience of building and implementing successful enterprise solutions, we know very well that email correspondence and CRM data stand among the key assets of any modern business. For this reason handling all communications between your email and CRM systems and Revenue Grid with maximum security is our topmost priority.

We follow a multi-level layered approach, which is continuously updated with the latest technologies to ensure the highest level of security for our customers' data, from complete physical security of Microsoft certified data centers we use to secured access authorization procedures for the end users (see below) and the [latest encrypted data transfer protocols](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office365/troubleshoot/security/prepare-tls-1.2-in-office-365).  

&nbsp;

#### Application Design

[Revenue Inbox Sync component](https://smartcloudconnect.io/docs/fast-channel/articles/AddIn-vs-Sync-Functions/), also used in Revenue Grid's architecture, is built as a scalable customized [Microsoft Azure service](https://searchcloudcomputing.techtarget.com/definition/Windows-Azure) which supports geo-distributed data centers and provides the highest levels of availability and resilience; it matches Microsoft's standards for secure applications.

[The Sidebar widget component of Revenue Grid](../Sidebar/) is a web rendition of an [MS Outlook add-in](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook/add-ins/) verified by Microsoft that works directly with users' email and CRM data, also displaying relevant information for the end users and conveying their inputs, actions, and choices to Revenue Grid, email server or Salesforce.

&nbsp;

#### Service Authentication

All RG end users follow the most secure access authentication procedures:

* [Single Sign-On](https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=sso_about.htm&type=5) to access Salesforce and [OAuth 2.0](https://oauth.net/2/) for Office 365

* Using [OAuth 2.0](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-oauth2-auth-code-flow) to grant MS Exchange data access, with optional fallback to login/password authentication for legacy MS Exchange servers



&nbsp;

#### Granular Access Control

Our app's access to user configurations and data is built on granular level, it is based on the concepts of Permissions, Roles, Principals, Resources and Authorizations:

*   All data views, transfers, or other related actions are controlled by structured permission rules
*   Combination of Permission sets into Roles allows to define allowed operations scopes very specifically
*   In RG data access architecture, assigning of Principals, Roles for specific Resources access, results in granting of the minimum required permissions level for performing of very specific tasks

This access control policy covers **all** Revenue Grid users, including Invisible.io Admins: Sales, Support and Customer Success teams, to ensure that the customers' data is accessible **only** by the entitled end users.

&nbsp;

#### Data Protection

Revenue Grid ensures multi-level protection of sensitive data from accidental or malicious loss, whether in transit, at rest, or on the go. Among standard techniques, that includes:

*   **Access to Salesforce, Office 365, and Gmail data** is performed through certified apps on respective services  
*   **In-transit encryption**: all data transfers between Salesforce/Microsoft Exchange or Google servers as well as user interactions with them via RG are encrypted with [TLS protocol](https://www.internetsociety.org/deploy360/tls/basics/)  
*   **At rest encryption**: all relevant configuration data is encrypted in rest state on [physical storage database level](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-service-encryption)  
*   **Secrets handling**: all used access secrets (tokens, passwords) are additionally encrypted on application level using keys transferred separately from the data. Furthermore, RG [API connections](https://www.upwork.com/hiring/development/intro-to-apis-what-is-an-api/) are designed in such a way so access secrets never leave Revenue Grid perimeter  
*   **Data backup and point-in-time restore**: users' and orgs' configuration data is continuously backed-up automatically; it is kept as multiple copies, ensuring the possibility to do a point-in-time restore
*   **Data isolation**: [server-side synchronization of data](https://smartcloudconnect.io/docs/fast-channel/articles/SmartCloud-Connect-Synchronization-An-Overview/) of different RG users is logically and physically isolated, which guarantees that no data can be transferred or leak between the users, in any other ways but ones defined by Salesforce or Microsoft Exchange / Office 365 / Gmail

&nbsp;

#### Infrastructure

*   **Data centers**: Revenue Grid is hosted on [Microsoft Azure data centers](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/global-infrastructure/) which ensure the [highest security levels](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security/fundamentals/overview)
*   **Security Updates**: Revenue Grid is a managed cloud solution; that, regular besides updates of RG features, implies automatic front-end and back-end data security infrastructure updates  
*   **Firewalls and network access**: Revenue Grid uses Microsoft Azure's capabilities to run its services in a secure virtual network with limited and strictly audited external access
*   **Networking**: no server used by Revenue Grid for user data transfers or config keeping is accessible from outside the network. Any externally visible services operate behind a firewall and a load balancer within this virtual private network
