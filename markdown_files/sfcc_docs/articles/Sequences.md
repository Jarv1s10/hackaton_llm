### Sequence stage vs Person status

Every recipient in Revenue Grid has his/her <a href="../Prospect-Statuses/">Person Status</a>, which gets updated based on his/her <a href="../Sequences-Stages/">Sequence stage</a>. Sequence stage in its turn is based on interactions and progress within the sequences enrolled into.<br><br>

First, when added to a sequence, a prospect falls onto "Not contacted" sequence stage regardless of his/her Person Status.<br><br>

Some of the sequence stage changes trigger <a href="../Signals/">Revenue Grid Signals</a> and automatic creation/update Salesforce records.<br><br>

When creating a Sequence, if you do <b>not</b> want prospect's status to get updated automatically, clear the <a href="../Settings-of-Sequences/#details">Do not map sequence stage change on Person status</a> checkbox in settings. That is useful, for example, if you run a secondary nurturing Sequence.

### Favorite sequences

Revenue Grid users can mark frequently used Sequences as <i>Favorite</i> on the Sequences tab, to quickly access and manage or reuse them. To mark a Sequence as favorite, click the star icon in the corresponding column of the Sequences list.

Favorite Sequences will always be brought up to the top of the Sequences list, and in addition all RG to-dos/notifications related to them will be similarly prioritized on the [Action Center](../Planner/), brought to the top of the list and marked with star icons. Multiple favorite Sequences are sorted according to their creation date, older Sequences ascending to the top. The same sorting pattern is applied to RG Planner to-dos/notifications related to favorite Sequences.
