Endorsed Sequences are those that have been created within your company by you or your colleagues and marked by a special tag "Endorsed".
The purpose of such tag is to sort out Sequences that are very important, proofed to be effective and encouraged to use by your Sales leadership.
Such tag is addable by Revenue Grid users with Admin rights only. 
Admin users can add such tag <a href="../Create-new-sequence/#create_a_new_sequence">while creating a sequence</a>, or to <a href="../Sequences/#manage_a_sequence">already existing sequence</a>.
