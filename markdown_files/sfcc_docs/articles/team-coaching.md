## Find the most active Sales Rep

The chart on the Revenue Grid Team page conveniently shows all your Sales representative's activities sorted from the most active employee to the least one. You can refer to it for the purpose of sales coaching. <br>

Colors on the chart represent types of activity, which all get gathered automatically from email clients, calendars and Salesforce. No manual entries are required.
