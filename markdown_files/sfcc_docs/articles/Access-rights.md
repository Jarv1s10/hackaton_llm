A regular user can:
<p style="margin-left:5%;"><i>Sequences</i></p>
<p style="margin-left:10%;">
• Create Sequences.<br>
• <a href="../Sequences/#manage_a_sequence">Clone</a> <b>shared</b> sequences created by other users.<br>
• View sequences that have ever included recipients the user owns in Salesforce.<br>
• View and edit own private or shared sequences.<br>
</p>

<p style="margin-left:5%;"><i>Recipients</i></p>
<p style="margin-left:10%;">
• Add own (on Salesforce level) recipients to private or shared sequences.<br>
• Add any accessible (on Salesforce level) recipients to private sequences.<br>
• Can view <a href="../Replies/">replies</a> from recipients and run <a href="../Action-required/">actions</a> on recipients if senders is the user.<br>
• Can view the complete <a href="../prospect-profile/">prospect profile</a> of own(on Salesforce level) recipients, or limited <a href="../prospect-profile/">prospect profile</a> of recipients who have ever received an email from the user. The limitation in such case is, the user will see only those events in the History Feed, which are related to the user, other events will be hidden.<br>
