!!! tip "Tip"
    Besides serving as a Mailbox ↔ Salesforce integration tool, {{ product_name }} is an integral part of a premium [revenue intelligence](https://revenuegrid.com/blog/what-is-guided-selling/) platform [{{ company_name }}](https://revenuegrid.com). Check out [the {{ company_name }} Docs](https://docs.revenuegrid.com/) for more information

&nbsp;

{{ product_name }} ({{ short_name }} onwards) brings all power of Salesforce seamlessly into your mailbox, making it easy for you to process data between your email client running on any platform and your CRM on several intuitive clicks. Business data handling is performed fully automatically or selectively; the solution excludes the necessity to switch back and forth between applications and data copy-pasting.

!!! note "Note"
    {{ product_name }} is **not** a standalone application, it is an [Add-In installed in your MS Outlook Desktop or On the Web version](https://appsource.microsoft.com/en-us/product/office/WA104379517?tab=Overview), also available as a [Chrome Extension for Gmail](../Using-the-Solution-for-Salesforce-and-Gmail/)

&nbsp;

After you have [installed {{ product_name }}](../How-to-Install-and-Run-the-Solution-all-configurations/), three {{ short_name }} icons are added to your MS Outlook Desktop ribbon. These icons are: *Open {{ product_name }}*, [*Quick Save to Salesforce*](../Saving-Emails-in-Salesforce-2.-Ways-to-Save-an-Email-(Adaptive-view)/#3_besides_using_the_save_button_emails_saving_can_be_performed_in_4_more_easy_ways), *Log a Call*, [*Quick Send Availability*](../Sharing-Calendar-Availability-(Adaptive-view)/), [*Track Email Opens*](../How-to-Use-the-Solution-s-Engagement-Panel/) (in email compose mode). 
In Outlook on the Web they are available as items in the actions menu located next to email body. See [this article](../Open-in-Outlook-Web/) for complete information.

 &nbsp;

To start working with {{ short_name }} Add-In, open {{ product_name }} by clicking on the corresponding button in [MS Outlook Desktop](../How-to-Install-and-Run-the-Solution-all-configurations/#1_to_open_the_sidebar) or [On the Web](../Open-in-Outlook-Web/).

!!! tip "Tip"
    You can "zoom in" the Sidebar to make its text bigger the way you zoom in web pages. To do that, click on the Sidebar, press the *Control (Ctrl)* button and scroll up the mouse wheel. All Sidebar components will be expanded and slightly re-arranged.
    To accommodate the expanded controls in the Sidebar's pane, you can also stretch the Sidebar sideways: hover the cursor over the left-hand edge of the Sidebar so it looks like this **⇼**, then hold the left mouse button and stretch the Sidebar sidewards

!!! note "Note"
    Note that {{ product_name }} is rendered identically in all its implementations: the "cloud" implementation in MS Outlook Desktop, [Outlook.com](https://outlook.live.com) and [Office 365](https://outlook.office.com/owa/) as well as in the ["desktop" implementation](../Desktop-MSI-and-Cloud-Web-Implementations-Comparison/).
    However, its [Gmail implementation](../How-to-Set-Up-the-Chrome-Extension-for-Salesforce-and-Gmail/) is [slightly different](../Using-the-Solution-for-Salesforce-and-Gmail/#differences_between_the_exchangeoffice_365_add-in_implementation_and_the_chrome_extension_for_gmail).
