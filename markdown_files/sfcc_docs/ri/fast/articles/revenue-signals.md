{{ company_name }}, being an integral component of [{{ company_name }} revenue intelligence solution]( https://docs.revenuegrid.com/), also includes tools for enhancing the sales process in your org. Revenue Signals are one of such features.    
  
Revenue Signals are the manually or automatically generated notifications that tell the individual sales representative or the whole sales team about the progress of the deals – whether they are going well or poorly.    
  
These alerts signal the sales team about the next step they should take or anything that does or doesn't go according to the pipeline, process, or performance plan. Revenue Signals notify the sales representatives about critical occurrences, so they don't miss anything, and timely respond by taking suggested actions. 

!!! tip "Tip"    
    Refer to [this {{ company_name }} article]( https://docs.revenuegrid.com/articles/Signals/) for a more detailed overview of Revenue Signals

After the Revenue Signals feature is enabled, an extra tab (section) *Signals*  is added to [{{ short_name }} Sidebar]( ../Introduction/):

Like other tabs (sections, separators), the signals tab can be [moved up or down in the Sidebar or pinned to be displayed even when it's empty](../Customization-Settings-Explained/#7_changing_card_order_and_pinning_cards).
