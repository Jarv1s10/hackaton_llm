!!! tip "Tip"
    This special feature is available only for those users who have a more advanced [{{ company_name }} license](https://revenuegrid.com/pricing/) with [Revenue Signals](https://docs.revenuegrid.com/articles/Signals/)

&nbsp;

{{ company_name }}, being an integral component of [{{ company_name }} revenue intelligence solution](https://docs.revenuegrid.com/), also includes tools for enhancing business email communication. Stale Thread Reminder is one of these features.  
This feature addresses a common issue that affects prospects engagement communication and other kind of multi-step business correspondence. For example, it is very handy in case a prospect expresses a preliminary interest and then gets carried away by other matters, putting your business communication on an indefinite hold.

After the Reminder feature is enabled, an extra tab (section) *Reminder* is added to [{{ product_name }}](../Introduction/):

</p>

&nbsp;

Like other tabs (sections, separators), the Reminder tab can be [moved up or down in the Sidebar or pinned to be displayed even when it's empty](../Customization-Settings-Explained/#7_changing_card_order_and_pinning_cards).

#### What Stale Thread Reminder does

- **In {{ product_name }}:** after the Reminder is set for an email, the tab signals when a follow up is needed to bolster the conversation. A thread is considered stale if the recipient does not respond in it within a set time period  
- **In MS Exchange / Office 365:** stale email threads pop up to the top of MS Outlook Inbox with automatic "forward to self" email copies which include a text *"You need to follow up on this email"* in order to get noticed as priority ones for bolstering

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

#### To set the Reminder

**1\.** Select an email belonging to a thread that you want to monitor for future bolstering if there is no response

!!! warning "Important"
    Note that the Reminder works only for emails selected in MS Outlook in [Read mode](../Saving-Emails-in-Salesforce-2.-Ways-to-Save-an-Email-%28Adaptive-view%29/#2_when_revenue_grid_sync_is_not_active) in the folders *Inbox* or *Sent*

&nbsp;

**2\.** Open the *Reminder* tab in {{ short_name }}
