Starting with Salesforce Spring 2021 update, customers who use [Salesforce Lightning Scheduler](https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=ls_overview.htm&type=5) can do the following via {{ company_name }}'s Lightning Scheduler adapter (LSA):

- parse own and colleaguesâ€™ actual calendar availability data from their MS Outlook calendars to be used in [Salesforce Lightning Scheduler](https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=ls_overview.htm&type=5)
- easily down-sync to MS Outlook calendar their Salesforce Events created with Scheduling App, this way ensuring that their calendars are always up to date and in sync

    Also see [this {{ company_name }} article](https://revenuegrid.com/blog/salesforce-lightning-scheduler/) for more information on using Salesforce Lightning Scheduler

&nbsp;

{{ company_name }} ensures this possibility by establishing interaction between [Salesforce Lightning Scheduler](https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=ls_overview.htm&type=5) and the users' Exchange accounts over several API endpoints. This article explains how these API methods and properties work.

    Also see this video <https://youtu.be/D6betOrxAwo> to learn in detail how the users work with {{ product_name }} in Salesforce Lightning Scheduler

&nbsp;

### Specific calendar actions performed over API

- Read, Create, Update, Delete calendar items on MS Exchange servers. This also includes: attendees availability spans parsing from their calendars; adding a booked Appointment based on a Lightning Scheduler Event to the attendees' calendars
- Checking if the above listed actions were performed successfully; troubleshooting possible errors, e.g. Exchange data access issues
- Indicating which attendee is the meeting's organizer

&nbsp;

**Prerequisites:**

Slightly different sets of prerequisites are required to perform the call *Read* (retrieve availability) and the calls *Create, Update, Delete.*

For *Read* method the prerequisites are:

- Create a [{{ company_name }} Org](../Managing-Organizations-via-the-Admin-Panel/) which the attendees belong to
- {{ company_name }} *access_token* acquired for a special user, a user belonging to the same {{ short_company_name }} Org with a valid MS Exchange credentials setup
- Other users whose availability is retrieved should belong to the same Exchange Org as the special user

&nbsp;

For *Create, Update, Delete* calls, the prerequisites are as follows:

- Create a [{{ company_name }} Org](../Managing-Organizations-via-the-Admin-Panel/) authorized via a service Impersonation Account which the attendees belong to
- All users whose Lightning Scheduler Events will be down-synced to Outlook should belong to the same [{{ company_name }} Org](../Managing-Organizations-via-the-Admin-Panel/)
- {{ company_name }} *access_token* acquired for a user belonging to the same [{{ short_company_name }} Org](../Managing-Organizations-via-the-Admin-Panel/) that has Organization Admin permissions in the {{ short_company_name }} Org (the *updateOrganization* setting)
- Note that users mailboxes' [email aliases](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/admin/email/add-another-email-alias-for-a-user?view=o365-worldwide) are not supported for these methods: each Salesforce user is matched with a single {{ company_name }} user / email address

&nbsp;

**Special notes:**

All date and time properties in the calls and responses are set in the [ISO 8601 standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601): **YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ssZ**

All input and output dates and times are set in GMT time zone.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

### Access authorization token

Access authorization required to work with MS Exchange data is granted using an *access_token* acquired by [{{ company_name }} Sync Engine](../Synchronization-Engine-An-Overview/).

&nbsp;



**Salesforce Lightning Scheduler - Exchange downsyncing**

When Events created in Lightning Scheduler get down-synchronized to MS Outlook calendar, due to a technical limitation in MS Exchange {{ company_name }} creates a set of overlapping Appointments instead of a Meeting for every Attendee and the Event's Organizer.
