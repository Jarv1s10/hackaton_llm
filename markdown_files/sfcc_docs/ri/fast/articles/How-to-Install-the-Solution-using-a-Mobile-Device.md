!!! note "Note"
    Presently, due to [a limitation in MS Outlook Mobile](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook/add-ins/outlook-mobile-addins), [{{ short_name }} Add-In](../Introduction/) can only be used in MS Outlook for Android or iOS with Office 365 mail accounts, and not with MS Exchange accounts. At that, users' data from MS Exchange accounts can handled using [{{ company_name }} synchronization](../Synchronization-Engine-An-Overview/), through [auto-saving](../Configuring-Activities-Synchronization-Settings/#automatic_syncing_of_calendar_items_events_autosharing) or the custom "Salesforce" category / folder / list, as described in this article



!!! note "Note"
    {{ product_name }} is <u>not</u> a stand-alone Android or iOS application, it is an Add-In installed in web, desktop, and [mobile implementations of MS Outlook](https://w2.outlook.com/l/mobile)
