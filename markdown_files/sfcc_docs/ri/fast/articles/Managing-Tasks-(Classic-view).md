You can save new tasks to Salesforce or save existing tasks between Salesforce and your mail application. Task reminders are saved too, so that you do not forget anything important as you are walking out the door.

**Saving a Task in Salesforce**

You can save a task with Salesforce by doing one of the following:

*   When creating or editing a task, assign it to the “**Salesforce**” category or place it to the “**Salesforce Tasks**” folder in your tasks

&nbsp;

*   In the {{ product_name }} Add-In / Chrome Extension, in the **New** list, select **Task**. After you create the task, it will be automatically saved in Salesforce and (in Outlook) assigned the **Salesforce** category

You can also access tasks stored in Salesforce by doing the following:

*   In your tasks, go to the “**Salesforce Tasks**” folder

&nbsp;

**Editing a Task**

You can edit task details by doing one of the following:

*   In the {{ product_name }} Add-In / Chrome Extension, in the record card, click **Task** (or **Tasks**) and then click the task you want to edit

&nbsp;

*   Open the task in Outlook and edit the task details. If this task is assigned to the “**Salesforce**” category or located in the “**Salesforce Tasks**” folder, your changes will be automatically synchronized with Salesforce

!!! note "Note"
    Changes that were made to the task via the {{ product_name }} Add-In / Chrome Extension will appear immediately in Salesforce; however, changes made via Outlook will appear in Salesforce only after the next synchronization
