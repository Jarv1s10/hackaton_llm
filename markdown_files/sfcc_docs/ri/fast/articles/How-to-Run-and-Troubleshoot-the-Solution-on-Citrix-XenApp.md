[{{ product_name }} for Salesforce Desktop (.MSI) implementation](../Desktop-MSI-and-Cloud-Web-Implementations-Comparison/) can only be installed in MS Outlook Desktop version running on a Windows system. This implementation of the Add-In is compatible with MS Outlook 2013 - 2019 (full integration) and requires the latest version of MS Edge to be installed on your system to run.

There are 32-bit and 64-bit installation packages available, to be installed on 32-bit and 64-bit editions of MS Outlook respectively. Custom company-specific editions of {{ product_name }} for Salesforce Desktop (.MSI) are normally installed and managed by local assigned administrators using [mass deployment tools](../How-to-Install-and-Run-the-Desktop-MSI-implementation-MS-Outlook/) and [{{ product_name }} admin panel](../How-to-Log-In-to-the-Admin-Panel/).

{{ product_name }} demonstrates solid compatibility with MS Outlook, however under some circumstances (e.g. conflicts with other integration software installed) Add-In crashes might occur. If a crash occurs, please do the following to help us investigate the problem:

**1\.** Open the Run prompt in Windows (by pressing _Windows button+R_ )

&nbsp;

**2\.** Copy and paste the following path into the **Open:** box _%appdata%\\RevenueGrid.com\\{{ product_name }} Add-In\\Profile_ and click **OK**  
!!! note "Note"
    The full path to the folder is _C:\\Users\\%username%\\AppData\\Roaming\\RevenueGrid.com\\{{ product_name }} Add-In\\Profile_, where %username% is the current user's Windows profile name.  

&nbsp;

**3\.** Compress the _Logs_ folder into a .zip archive by right clicking it and selecting **Send To > Compressed (zipped) folder** (or you could use [7-Zip](http://www.7-zip.org/) / [WinRAR](http://www.rarlab.com/download.htm))

</p>
&nbsp;

**4\.** Send the zip archive to us to [our Support team](mailto:support@revenuegrid.com) along with a step-by-step description of actions and conditions which led to the crash (reproduction steps). If the zip file is too big to be attached attach to an email â€“ please upload it to a file hosting site like [Filedropper](http://www.filedropper.com/) or [Uploadfiles](https://uploadfiles.io/) and send us the link; in the latter case for security consideration make sure to [set a password on the zip archive](http://www.medicalnerds.com/how-to-encrypt-zip-files-securely-using-7zip/) and send it to us along with the link
