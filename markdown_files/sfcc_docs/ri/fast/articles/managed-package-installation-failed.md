This problem occurs on installing the managed package to [**Salesforce Professional Edition**](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.overview_edition.htm&type=5). This Salesforce edition does not include the [**Web Services API** component](https://www.salesforce.com/content/dam/web/en_us/www/documents/pricing/DS_SalesCloud_EdCompare.pdf) that is necessary for the {{ company_name }} Solution to make the callout and populate the custom setting automatically. However, this component can be enabled by Salesforce for an additional fee.

## How to handle the issue

To handle the problem, make sure that you are using the Salesforce Professional Edition. Refer to [this Salesforce Help article](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.overview_finding_edition.htm&type=5) to find out which edition you are using.

The {{ company_name }} Managed Package can operate without the **Web Services API** component, therefore, a separate managed package version was explicitly developed for Salesforce Professional Edition users.
