{{ company_name }} Support may ask you to [grant login access](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=000355550&type=1) to help you with a question and facilitate troubleshooting and resolving issues.  [Login access](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=000355550&type=1) is the Salesforce functionality that enables one user to log in as another user to assist in addressing issues that are impossible to fix in other ways.

In this way, after you provide explicit permission and grant login access, {{ company_name }} can log in to your account solely to troubleshoot and fix issues related to your support inquiry. The terms of technical support are outlined in the [Terms and Conditions](https://revenuegrid.com/terms-conditions/) and [Privacy & Security Policy](../Privacy-and-Security/).

!!! warning "Important"
    This is a **preferred method** of granting account login access to {{ company_name }} Support for users whose organizations have a special [**{{ company_name }} Salesforce managed package**](../Admin-Managed-Package/) installed.

!!! tip "Tip"
