    To expand Salesforce Reports integration with {{ product_name }}, ask your local Salesforce admin to set up {{ short_name }} managed Salesforce package in your Org. See [this article](../Admin-Managed-Package/) for complete information about the package

## Working with Reports via Widgets in Salesforce

{{ product_name }} can help you to handle your Reports with most efficiency via Reports widgets added to your Salesforce.

!!! tip "Tip"
    The prerequisite for installing the widgets is to set up [{{ product_name }} Suite managed package](../Admin-Managed-Package/); this can only be done by your local Salesforce Admin

{{ product_name }} offers you the access to two {{ company_name }} Reports:
