{{ product_name }} is compatible with the following email servers. Please click on an Email server to learn more:

*   [Microsoft Office 365 (with Exchange Online plan)](../Supported-Email-Clients-for-Microsoft-Office-365-(with-Exchange-Online-plan)/)
*   [Microsoft Exchange 2016, 2019](../Supported-Email-Clients-for-Microsoft-Exchange-2013,-2016/)
*   [Gmail](../Supported-Email-Clients-for-Gmail/), via [{{ product_name }} Chrome Extension](../Using-the-Solution-for-Salesforce-and-Gmail/)
*   Other email servers using POP/IMAP and SMTP protocols - only via the [Desktop (MSI) implementation of {{ product_name }}](../How-to-Install-and-Run-the-Desktop-MSI-implementation-MS-Outlook/) (no special compatibility guaranteed)

!!! note "Note"
    Pay attention that starting from June 2022, [Microsoft ceased support and updates of the Internet Explorer 11 desktop application](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/announcements/internet-explorer-11-end-of-support) on most versions of Windows 10 and encouraged its customers to move to other browsers. Since the MS Outlook 2013 for desktop uses Internet Explorer 11 engine to render embedded add-ins in its interface, it will be impossible to run {{ product_name }} on this version of MS Outlook. Learn more in [this {{ short_company_name }} article](https://docs.revenuegrid.com/ri/fast/articles/internet-explorer-end-of-support/)

&nbsp;

!!! warning "Important"
    {{ product_name }} interacts with MS Exchange servers over [Exchange web services (EWS)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/exchange/client-developer/exchange-web-services/start-using-web-services-in-exchange), so an essential prerequisite for using the tool is that EWS are enabled on your Exchange server. Refer to [this Microsoft connectivity test page](https://testconnectivity.microsoft.com/) to check your EWS connectivity: on this page, open the **Exchange Server** tab and run  
    **1.** *Exchange ActiveSync* test  
    **2.** *Exchange ActiveSync Autodiscover* test  
    **3.** *Synchronization, Notification, Availability, and Automatic Replies* test

**\* What 'Yes+Pin' means?** Sidebar Add-In [can be 'pinned'](../Sidebar-Pinning/), so you do not need to reopen it each time browsing different emails or meetings in your email client. Please note, *Outlook 2016* one-time purchase version and older Outlook versions do not support {{ product_name }} pinning. Only *Exchange 2016* and newer Exchange versions support {{ short_name }} pinning

**\*\*** Presently, due to [a limitation in MS Outlook Mobile](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook/add-ins/outlook-mobile-addins), in MS Outlook for Android/iOS the Add-In can be used with Office 365/Office.com accounts only. However, your data can be exchanged with Salesforce using [{{ short_name }} sync](../Synchronization-Engine-An-Overview/) (through [auto-syncing](../Configuring-Activities-Synchronization-Settings/#automatic_syncing_of_calendar_items_events_autosharing) or [the custom "Salesforce Emails" folder](../Saving-Emails-in-Salesforce-2.-Ways-to-Save-an-Email-(Adaptive-view)/#3_besides_using_the_save_button_emails_saving_can_be_performed_in_4_more_easy_ways)).

Supported Email Clients for Gmail 
--------

{{ product_name }} can work with Gmail and G Guite servers only through the dedicated [Chrome Browser Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/revenue-inbox-for-salesfo/agfekjndkedoakoeahndfnjilkifbicn?hl=en) that is added to Gmail / Google Workspace (G Suite) web interface.

- The latest update of Google Chrome or a Chromium based browser available for your operating system  
- A corporate Gmail / Google Workspace (G Suite) account  
- A Salesforce account

Internet Explorer End of Support 
--------

Since Microsoft stopped supporting the [Internet Explorer 11 desktop application](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/announcements/internet-explorer-11-end-of-support) on most versions of Windows 10, {{ company_name }} discontinued support of {{ product_name }} for Internet Explorer and older MS Outlook versions that use the Internet Explorer browser to render add-ins. 


To ensure maximum performance and compatibility, all {{ short_name }} users are recommended to upgrade to Windows 10 build *1903 or above* and Microsoft 365 / Office package version *16.0.11629 or above*.
