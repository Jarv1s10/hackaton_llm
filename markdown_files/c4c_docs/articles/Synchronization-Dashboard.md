# Synchronization Dashboard

&nbsp;

The Sync dashboard is accessible by all users. After Cloud for Customer SSI has been deployed for a user, the Sync dashboard is added to their SAP C4C page under **E-Mail Integration** > **User Settings**.

    [Key Users](https://www.sap.com/documents/2018/10/febc12f6-227d-0010-87a3-c30de2ffd8ff.html) in an Org may restrict the possibility to adjust customization settings for some users and groups of users

Actions you can perform on Cloud for Customer SSI Sync dashboard:

&nbsp;

- Access your Profile **Customization** to adjust [Cloud for Customer SSI Add-In](../Customization-Settings-Addin/) and [Synchronization](../Customization-Settings-Sync/) functioning patterns   

&nbsp;

- In **Sync Settings** > **E-Mail Configuration** in the Dashboard pane, you can set up or update your mailbox access credentials for Cloud for Customer SSI Sync (see the paragraph on **Change Settings** above)  

&nbsp;

- Under **Sync Settings** > **Detailed Settings** you will also find the button Localization: **Apply**. This button is used to apply a general SAP C4C language update to SSI settings (*E-Mail Integration* tabs). The language to be used in Cloud for Customer SSI settings is read from users' SAP C4C configuration on their [provisioning](../How-to-Configure-Admin/#24_user_provisioning) and in case you change SAP C4C localization later, use this button to change localization of [SSI Sync](../C4C-SSI-Sync-Overview/) related items (dedicated folder names, custom category names, e-mail templates' language) to match the current user's language set in SAP C4C
