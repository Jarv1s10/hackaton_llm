# SSI Add-In View Problems in Microsoft Outlook 2013

&nbsp;

## Symptoms

SAP Cloud for Customer Server-Side Integration Add-In has different views in MS Outlook 2013 and MS Outlook 2016. In MS Outlook 2013, the SSI Add-In button **isn't available** in the ribbon as well as a sidebar.

In MS Outlook 2013, Add-In is located in a custom pane only, but users expect to see the Add-In button in the ribbon and use the sidebar.

This is how users may use Add-In in **MS Exchange 2013** (Outlook Web Access).

In **MS Outlook 2016**, Add-In is available from the ribbon and as a sidebar, as we got used.

## Causes

The root cause is the **absence of MS Outlook 2013 updates** (thus, it is not an SSI Add-In issue).

To show the SSI Add-In button in the ribbon and allow the use of the sidebar, MS Outlook 2013 should support **Add-In commands**. MS Outlook Add-In commands provide ways to initiate specific Add-In actions from the ribbon by adding buttons or drop-down menus. This lets users access Add-Ins in a simple, intuitive, and unobtrusive way â€“ users will have an Add-In button in the ribbon and may use the sidebar.
