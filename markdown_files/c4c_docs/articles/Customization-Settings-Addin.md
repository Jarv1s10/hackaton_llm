# Cloud for Customer SSI Add-In Settings

!!! note "Note"
    End users' permissions to modify Cloud for Customer SSI settings are defined in your Org settings. Several Add-In settings can only be modified by [Key Users](https://www.sap.com/documents/2018/10/febc12f6-227d-0010-87a3-c30de2ffd8ff.html)

&nbsp;

Cloud for Customer SSI is a highly customizable tool; it is designed to meet the needs of different categories of users following different workflows. Profile Settings management is an advanced Cloud for Customer SSI feature that enables the end users to manage and fine-tune Cloud for Customer SSI Add-In's behavior: what objects and activities will be handled by the Add-In and how specific fields will be processed. Also refer to [this article](../Customization-Settings-Sync/) for information on Cloud for Customer SSI Synchronization Settings.

    After making any adjustments in the settings, make sure to click the **Save** button in the upper right corner of the tab to save and apply them

&nbsp;

A [Key User](https://www.sap.com/documents/2018/10/febc12f6-227d-0010-87a3-c30de2ffd8ff.html) can adjust profile settings for any user in an Org or modify a Profile template used by group of users via the "Groupware settings" tab. Ordinary users can use their "Add-In Settings" tab to adjust some aspects of their individual configurations.

Profile templates managed by the Key users are essentially sets of function adjustments specific to groups of users with different roles in the CRM; the Templates contain more settings than individual Profiles.
