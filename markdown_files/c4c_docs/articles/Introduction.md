Server-Side Integration ("*SSI*" onwards) brings all power of SAP Cloud or Customer seamlessly into your mailbox, making it easy for you to process data between your e-mail client running on any platform and SAP Cloud for Customer on several intuitive clicks. SSI data handling is performed fully automatically or selectively; the solution excludes the necessity to switch back and forth between applications and data copy-pasting.

&nbsp;

!!! note "Note"
    SSI is **not** a standalone application, it is an [Add-In installed in your MS Outlook App or on the Web version](../How-to-Open-C4C-SSI-Sidebar/), also available as a [Chrome Extension for Gmail](../Use-with-Gmail/). The Sidebar's look and functions are mostly identical on all platforms

&nbsp;

After [SSI has been installed for you](../How-to-Configure-Admin/):

- Server-Side Integration tabs appear in your SAP Cloud for Customer profile. [See this article](../How-to-Open-Your-C4C-SSI-Settings-Profile/) for complete information  
- Several custom categories and/or folders appear in your mail client:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**A.** *SAP E-Mails* for e-mails  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**B.** *SAP Cloud for Customer* for calendar items  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**C.** *SAP Contacts*, *SAP Accounts*, *SAP Individual Customers* for Outlook Contacts  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**D.** *SAP Tasks* for Outlook Tasks  
- An SSI icon is added to your MS Outlook Desktop ribbon and MS Outlook on the Web context actions menu. The icon reads *"View context of SAP Cloud for Customer"*; in Outlook on the Web the SAP icon is available in the actions menu next to a viewed or composed e-mail  

&nbsp;

After you click on the icon in [MS Outlook Desktop ribbon](../How-to-Open-C4C-SSI-Sidebar/), in [Outlook on the Web context menu](../Open-in-Outlook-Web/), or in [Gmail web interface](../Use-with-Gmail/), you will see SSI Sidebar:

 &nbsp;



!!! tip "Tip"
    You can "zoom in" the Sidebar to make its text bigger the way you zoom in web pages. To do that, click on the Sidebar, press the *Control (Ctrl)* button and scroll the mouse wheel up. All Sidebar components will be expanded and slightly re-arranged.
    To accommodate the expanded controls in the Sidebar's pane, you can also stretch the Sidebar sideways: hover the cursor over the left-hand edge of the Sidebar so it looks like this **â‡¼**, then hold the left mouse button and stretch the Sidebar leftwards
