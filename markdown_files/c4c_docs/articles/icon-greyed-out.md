## No e-mail is selected

SSI Add-In’s icon becomes clickable only if you have an e-mail opened in your mail client. If no e-mail is, the Add-In’s icon is unclickable.

First, **open an e-mail** you want to save to SAP Cloud for Customer in your mail client, then **click on the SSI Add-In icon** in the ribbon to open the sidebar.
