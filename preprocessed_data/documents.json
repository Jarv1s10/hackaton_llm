This is the recommended approach, since it doesnt require any actions from the end users to complete tool deployment\n1.2\nAuthentication based on Microsoft Exchange Direct Logon (or Office 365 Oauth, or Google Direct Logon) is a scenario where general deployment is carried out by the local Admin, by setting up SAP Cloud for Customer SSI Add-In, but after that the users must log in to the Add-In and\nenter their Microsoft Exchange/Office 365/Google credentials in its settings\n. This approach is less recommended and can be applied for smaller groups of users, since it requires additional actions from the end users to complete tool deployment",

To improve the synchronization performance, SSI Sync filters old calendar items according to a sliding date period that avoids syncing large amounts of irrelevant past events data.\nThe sliding date period filter allows SSI Sync to keep Appointments and Visits in a synchronization scope that were held\n30 days ago and later\n(closer to the current date). At the same time, this filter has no limits for future calendar events. Once the event (Appointment / Visit) is out of the synchronization scope, it will be unsynchronized according to the pattern described in\nthis article\n, see the\nOut of Filter\ncolumn. Therefore, the sliding date period ensures that all relevant events are kept in sync in both users SAP Cloud for Customer and e-mail client calendars.\nAlso, the auto-sync meetings feature allows SSI Sync to automatically capture and synchronize MS Outlook events that go\n14 days in the past\nand\n60 days in the future\nto SAP Cloud for Customer. Then, they will be in a synchronization scope until they stay within the sliding date period described above.\nProcessing events not matching filter criteria\nWhen SAP Cloud for Customer Visits and Appointments become too old to match the sliding date period filter criteria, SSI Sync will process in the following ways:\nIf SAP Cloud for Customer Visit or Appointment (meeting in Exchange) has attendees  the event will remain in Exchange (Google) calendar, and the custom SAP category will be cleared out\nIf SAP Cloud for Customer Visit or Appointment (appointment in Exchange) has no attendees  the event will be deleted from Exchange (Google) calendar\nIf Visit or Appointment originated in an e-mail client calendar has no attendees  the event will remain in Exchange (Google) calendar, and the custom SAP category will be cleared out\nTip\nIf you want an appointment with attendees to be\ndeleted\nfrom the Exchange calendar, the Global Setting\nServiceEventDeletionStrategy\nshould be set to 0.

The recurring event may end after a particular number of occurrences, may last up to a fixed End Date or forever. There are certain conditions on how many of those occurrences are synced to SAP Cloud for Customer.\nThe limit on occurrences that are visible in SAP Cloud for Customer are as follows:\nDaily and weekly frequency: two months\nMonthly frequency: six months\nEvents with a yearly pattern are not supported and wont be synced\nIt is impossible to create a recurring event via the SAP Cloud for Customer interface, therefore, it is unavailable to create it via SSI Add-In. On the other hand, the SSI sync component can create recurrent events on SAP Cloud for Customer (through API). The recurrent series is not visible on SAP Cloud for Customer, however, it may be found under the related tab of a particular object, such as Contact, in the shape of Recurring Activity (Visit or Appointment).\nExample of Recurring Activity in Add-In\nMonthly meeting with Jason\nunder related Contact:\nDetailed view of Recurring Activity (Visit):\nRecurrence EndDate is set to ( - ) dash\nSometimes, it may be noticed that Recurrence EndDate is not showing any End Date and reflecting  -  (dash). Such behavior can be observed when a user creates a recurrent activity with a particular count of occurrences, and then it is up-synced from MS Outlook to SAP Cloud for Customer. So if the recurring rule defines the\nCOUNT OF OCCURRENCES\nor\nNo End Date\n(on the MS Outlook side), then we send zero time in\nRecurrenceEndDate\n. This is system behavior related to SAP Cloud for Customer API limitations. Since it results in reflecting 1970 as the year of the End Date, from the users perspective, it had been decided to show only a dash to avoid confusion.\nMS Outlook appointment with a defined count of occurrences:",

        "page_content": "Support of Encrypted and Signed E-Mails\n[ This article is work-in-progress ]\nWhat are Encrypting and Digital Signature\nEncrypting an e-mail message\nin Microsoft Office Outlook protects the privacy of the message by converting it from (readable) plain-text into (scrambled) cipher-text. Only the recipient who has the private key that matches the public key used to encrypt the message can decipher the message for reading. Any recipient without the corresponding private key would see only garbled text. More details about encrypted e-mail can be found\nhere\n.\nA digital signature\nattached to an e-mail message offers another layer of security by assuring the recipient that you  not an imposter  signed the contents of the e-mail message. Your digital signature, which includes your certificate and public key, originates from your digital ID. And that digital ID serves as your unique digital mark and signals the recipient that the content hasnt been altered in transit. More details about the signed e-mail can be found\nhere\n.\nHow Encrypting and Digital Signature works\nThe Add-In supports native MS Outlook\nencryption functionality\nwith certificates issued by different vendors.\nAfter MS Outlook is configured to encrypt e-mails, new buttons\nEncrypt\nand\nSign\nare added to the ribbon of the e-mail.\nSuch e-mail has a corresponding sign that identifies this e-mail as encrypted one.\nIn order to exchange with encrypted e-mail, both users should obtain e-mail certificates and exchange with certificate public keys.\nSupport of encrypted and signed e-mails\nThe complicated encryption and digital signing logic create many limitations which prevent SSI Sync and Add-In from properly operating.\nIn case the user selects an encrypted and/or signed e-mail message and tries to\nopen the Add-In\n, the following error message will occur:\nYou cannot perform this action. Permission to this message is restricted\n.\nThis is a MS Outlook message, not an Add-In error. MS Outlook prevents add-in opening as it is not allowed to perform any operations with such e-mail messages.\nIf the user adds a SAP Cloud for Customer category to save encrypted/signed e-mail, the category will be added, but the e-mail wont be saved to SAP Cloud for Customer.\nAs a result, because of existing Microsoft limitations, there is no way to save encrypted or/and signed e-mail messages to SAP Cloud for Customer using SSI Sync or Add-In.",

        "page_content": "Cloud for Customer SSI Synchronization: An Overview\nTip\nAlso see\nthis article\nfor a functional comparison for SSI Sync Engine and SSI Add-In\nThe core data synchronization\nprocess\ndescribed in this article is not to be confused with the toggleable Cloud for Customer SSI\nfeatures\nauto-saving (auto-syncing) of every new incoming/outgoing e-mail or events, or auto-saving of new messages in selected correspondence threads. These functions are carried out by this process and if synchronization is not\nset up\nor\nis suspended\nby the user or due to an error, these features will not work.\nCloud for Customer SSI Synchronization (SSI Sync) is a recurrent background (server-side) process of two-way data exchange between your e-mail account (on an MS Exchange, Office 365, or Gmail server) and your SAP Cloud for Customer account, that the tool performs 24/7 to maintain consistency between your e-mail/calendar items and their matching SAP Cloud for Customer objects, also considering your choices and actions in Cloud for Customer SSI Sidebar and your e-mail client (via the dedicated category or folder. Cloud for Customer SSI Sync does\nnot\ndepend on whether Cloud for Customer SSI Add-In is opened in your e-mail client. The data is transferred securely server-to-server over\nEWS\nin the case of MS Exchange, or using\nTLS\n/\nSSL\nin the case of Gmail, and over the official and secure SAP Cloud for Customer API to/from your SAP Cloud for Customer account.\nBy default, Cloud for Customer SSI Sync is performed every 30 minutes; it runs regardless of whether Cloud for Customer SSI Sidebar or MS Outlook/other supported e-mail client is opened or not, as server-to-server data exchange unnoticed by the users.\nSince data exchange is carried out between your e-mail server and SAP Cloud for Customer server while your local e-mail client and the Sidebar only serve to display e-mail/calendar data and register your choices and actions, Cloud for Customer SSI Sync does not consume any noticeable amount of your local internet traffic.\nThe key aspects of synchronization process can be flexibly adjusted by the end users individually via\nSAP Cloud for Customer Profiles\n, or by the local admin via\nAdmin settings\n. Synchronization can be\nmanually suspended or forced to run sooner than the next scheduled session\n. It may also get suspended due to errors and monitored for troubleshooting.\nMaintaining data mirroring is based on tables of matching fields mapped between MS Exchange / Office 365 calendar items, Tasks, Contacts and corresponding SAP Cloud for Customer objects. These mapping tables are used to compare the values in matching fields and transfer updated values from e-mail server to SAP Cloud for Customer or vice versa, replacing old values in corresponding fields with actual ones. This ongoing data mirroring process has its specific exceptions and overriding patterns applied in certain cases as required by convenience of use considerations. Additionally, there are\ncustom sync adjustment options\nwhich alter the general reciprocal mirroring principle according to users preferences.\nNote\nUnlike continuous mirror-syncing of MS Exchange / Office 365 calendar items, Tasks, Contacts, saving of e-mails is always a one-way MS Exchange  SAP Cloud for Customer process by definition, and it is performed only one time per e-mail\nBesides this core data mirroring process, synchronization sessions include several interrelated jobs: checking for E-Mails, Events, Tasks, Contacts assigned the\nSAP Cloud for Customer\ncategory, creation of SAP Cloud for Customer objects based on new e-mails or calendar items and user input, finding and linking of related records in SAP Cloud for Customer, deletion of a matching object if the procedure requires that (for example, removal from SAP Cloud for Customer of an event that got cancelled on the e-mail server).\nImportant\nSome actions can only be performed via synchronization: saving of calendar items in SAP Cloud for Customer, saving of e-mail messages in\nCompose mode\n, saving of e-mails, contacts, or tasks by assigning them the\nSAP Cloud for Customer\ncategory or moving to the dedicated\nSAP Cloud for Customer\nfolder. Additionally, due to the sync interval it may take up to 30 minutes for a corresponding record to appear in SAP Cloud for Customer after your performed either of these saving actions. However, please note that several other actions involving creation or updating of SAP Cloud for Customer records do not depend on synchronization, as they are performed by Cloud for Customer SSI Add-In immediately in SAP Cloud for Customer, e.g. saving e-mail messages using the Save button in\nRead mode\nor initial saving (creation) of calendar items in SAP Cloud for Customer",

The operations are broken down and named separately there.\nNavigate to a file that describes affected operation, find the corresponding payload (request and response) defining the issue.\nIf the response contains any kind of message coming from the SAP side with corresponding response headers  it should be copied to a separate file (including a request) and attached to the incident as evidence. There could be no SAP response at all  the request may also be collected and sent to the SAP API team, asking for the reason for the absent response.\nPlease do not mix up the SAP response with an exception in\nC4C_dump\n. All exceptions are thrown from the SSI side and should be looked at by the SSI team in case the response from SAP is valid. Please do not attach the exception info for the SAP team since it is not their scope of responsibility to check it.\nThe response may be valid but not acceptable in terms of SSI design. Review the error message carefully and investigate the data returned by SAP. Check if the data returned is valid or not.\nThe same payloads can be generated using the OData monitor.\nTo check the authorization permissions, navigate to the\n001_Permissions_c4codataapi\nfile.

To view issues encountered with a certain handled item type, click on an item type (e.g. Contact, Accounts, Tasks, E-Mails, etc.)\nTip\nYou can also instantly view the item involved in the issue by clicking the\nSAP Cloud for Customer\nor\nExchange\nicon on the issue block\nAll SSI Sync issues also\nget logged in SSI Admin panel\nfor monitoring and resolution by the Key Users",

If there is any authentication enabled to access this URL, it should be disabled as well.\nFor example, try accessing the same URL in Office 365 (\nhttps://outlook.office365.com/autodiscover/metadata/json/1\n), a similar response is expected.\nThe Exchange server must accept incoming EWS (Exchange Web Services) calls from SAP Cloud for Customer Server-Side Integration. AutoDiscover may have to be set up. More details on AutoDiscover are available\nhere\n.\nSAP Cloud for Customer Server-Side Integration IP addresses to authorize on the Exchange server side are documented\nbelow\n. Incoming EWS calls can be assessed for legitimacy by checking that they originate from within this IP range and contain a valid JWT (JSON Web Token). Details about JWT are available\nhere\n.\nThe Exchange server is configured to generate JWTs properly, so they indicate the URL SAP Cloud for Customer Server-Side Integration utilized to connect to the Exchange server. That URL may be the same as the AutoDiscover URL and is referred to as the MetaData URL in the JWT. If SAP Cloud for Customer Server-Side Integration still doesnt work, a standard check to conduct is to review Certificates on the Exchange server and ensure their validity.\nMake sure that EWS is properly configured to be available inside and outside of the organization by executing the following command:\nC:\\windows\\system32>Get-WebServicesVirtualDirectory |Select name, *url* | fl\nExchange MetaData URL should be available from external networks, so if any proxy or firewall is used, make sure they are available from the internet.",

If you synchronize only contacts then 10,000 out of 15,000 will be synchronized between Salesforce and Exchange. RG Email Sidebar will retrieve the newest 10,000 contacts based on their creation date.\nSign up for a free trial\nWas this article helpful?\nYes\nNo\nGet back to us\nWe would love to hear from you!\nName:\nE-mail:\nComment:",

Check\nthis article\nfor more information\nRG Email Sidebar is a cloud application that performs two-way synchronization of data between your Salesforce account and Exchange mailbox and gives you access to Salesforce data right from your email client. After you create a RG Email Sidebar account using a simple\nregistration wizard\nand install\nthe MS Outlook Desktop or On the Web version Add-In\nor\nthe Chrome Extension\n, RG Email Sidebar will customize your mailbox by adding the required custom folders/labels, add its\nSidebar\n, and start\nsynchronizing your records\non server-side. The specifics of using the RG Email Sidebar Chrome Extension for Gmail are explained in\nthis article\n.\nThe data that\nRevenue Grid synchronizes\nincludes:\nContacts.\nIn Outlook, RG Email Sidebar creates a new contact folder named\nSalesforce Contacts\nwhere you can find your Salesforce contacts. To synchronize a newly created contact with Salesforce, assign it the\nSalesforce\ncategory or move it to the\nSalesforce Contacts\nfolder\nCalendar items.\nYour Salesforce and Outlook calendars are in sync. To save a new meeting or appointment in Salesforce, assign it the Salesforce category in Outlook or save it using the Outlook Add-In or Chrome Extension\nTasks.\nAs with contacts, RG Email Sidebar creates a new task folder named Salesforce Tasks in which you can find your tasks. By adding a new or moving an existing task to this folder, or assigning a task the custom Salesforce category in MS Outlook Desktop or On the Web version, you can quickly save it in Salesforce\nEmails\nand\nEmail Attachments\n.\nRG Email Sidebar creates a new folder named Salesforce Emails in your mailbox. Moving your emails to this folder will save them as completed tasks with Salesforce. Email attachments are also saved to Salesforce as attachments to the completed task\nSynchronization runs in the background (server-to-server) 24x7, one sync session every 30 minutes; the interval is defined by the set\nservice plan\n.",

        "page_content": "Saving Emails in Salesforce: An Overview\nThe basis of RG Email Sidebar functioning is carrying out special interactions between MS Exchange / Office 365 or Google mail/calendar and Salesforce through data transfer and synchronization between\ntheir matching objects fields\n. One of the key features of RG Email Sidebar is saving (sharing) emails/events as records in Salesforce and modifying them directly via the\nSidebar\n. This article provides a detailed overview of the mechanisms involved in saving email messages in Salesforce.\nPrimary Emails Processing\nAn email received or sent in MS Exchange / Office 365 or Gmail consists of the following elements: the senders email address, the recipients email addresses (the\nTo\n,\nCC\n, and\nBCC\nlines), the date and time of sending, the emails subject line, message body and its formatting , the senders signature, and the files attached to the email. When RG Email Sidebar for Salesforce processes a message opened in MS Outlook, it obtains all this data from MS Exchange/Gmail and based on the email address determines whether the message is\ninternal or blocklisted from Salesforce synchronization\nand finds in Salesforce the records related to it based on the senders and recipients addresses extracted. Also refer to\nthis article\nto learn more about these filtering mechanisms.\nEmails classified as internal / blocklisted (see the article linked above) are\nnot\nsaved in Salesforce automatically and besides the\nSave\nbutton in RG Email Sidebar is disabled for them. When such message is opened, to indicate why the message cannot be saved in Salesforce there appears a notification under\nSmart Actions\n>\nMore\n>\nObservations\nSome not important emails were filtered:\nwith the list of internal or blocklisted email addresses the message contains.\nAlso see\nthis article\nfor information on alternative scenarios available for of different saving modes with  the\nBlocklist\n.\nRefer to\nthis article\nto learn how to save such emails in Salesforce without\nremoving their addresses/domains from the blocklist\n.\nNote\nIf the messages full addresses list contains at least one non-internal/blocklisted email address, the message will be saveable in Salesforce as a brand new record or as one linked to\nassociated\nexisting records",

        "page_content": "Under the hood mechanisms and special patterns applied on Emails saving\n1.\nWhen a message is opened in RG Email Sidebar, the Add-In / Chrome Extension retrieves the described above\nmessage elements\nfrom MS Exchange/Gmail. Besides the email addresses, useful data from the messages signature (name, surname, position, phone number, company name and website address, etc.) as well as email addresses, links, or phone numbers  contained in message body are extracted and used to search for related records in the next step.\n2.\nNext,\nRelated records search in Salesforce\nis performed to determine if there has been previous communication (that is, saved Salesforce  records) related to message sender/recipients and other contact data found in the message. Furthermore, at this step RG Email Sidebar obtains relevant contextual information about the message to be displayed in the Sidebar and put in prefilled record fields, if related records are found.\n3.\nRevenue Grid auto-synchronization only handles emails located in the\nInbox\n,\nSent\nand custom\nSalesforce\nfolders of MS Outlook, it will\nnot\nprocess emails assigned the Salesforce category but located in other folders. The same concerns saving all emails in a thread, it applies only to the items in the\nInbox\nand\nSent\nMS Outlook folders.\nFor special emails saving scenarios requested by some customers, RG Email Sidebar also offers on-demand possibility to save any emails located in custom mailbox folders/subfolders. In this email auto-sync scenario, the customer can create new custom folders any time and exclude folders the customer doesnt want to sync.\n4.\nUnlike\ncalendar items syncing\n, emails saving and auto-saving is always a\none-way\nMS Exchange/Gmail  Salesforce process; saving of an individual email is only performed once, unless you delete its matching entry in Salesforce, and its content is not synchronized in any way in the future. For example, if you modify a\nTask/Email message\nSalesforce object based on an email message, these changes do not get\ndown-synchronized\nto your MS Exchange / Office 365 or Gmail and only remain in Salesforce.\nThere is also a special custom scenario where a saved email gets deleted from Salesforce to allow editing its Body via the Sidebar. See\nthis section of the article\nfor complete information\n5.\nEmails categories which do\nnot\nget auto-saved if\nthe corresponding Sync setting\nis on:\nInternal emails\nEmails from/to addresses/domains\nblocklisted from syncing\non the\nOrg level or individual level\nOut-of-the-box (with default config), RGES emails and calendar items that have no relevant Business or People records for linking, do not get auto-processed\nEmails placed into any other folders of your email client but\nInbox\n,\nSent\n, or the custom\nSalesforce Emails\none\nService emails (see below)",

Items saved in this way will be upsynced to Salesforce as soon as Internet connection is available.\nIn addition, this option can be effectively used to process multiple items\n1.\nBy assigning them the custom Salesforce category:\nclick\nCategorize\nin MS Outlook ribbon and select\nSalesforce\nfrom the picklist\nor right-click the item and select\nCategorize\n>\nSalesforce\n2.\nBy clicking the\nSave\nbutton at the top of RG Email Sidebar for the calendar item opened in a separate MS Outlook window.\nAfter you click\nSave\n, there will appear the\nSave current event as an Activity in Salesforce\ndialog:\nIn this dialog, you may change the primary record (a key Lead or Contact) that the Event will be linked to in Salesforce through\nWhoId relationship\nvia the\nName\nfield or specify an additional Business record to be\nassociated\nwith it using the optional\nRelated To\nfield.\nEither way, if it is initial saving of the calendar item, it will be saved in Salesforce on the next synchronization session; if the event object already exists, it will be updated immediately.\nNote\nBy default,\ninternal (in-company) meetings\n(calendar items in which all attendees and the organizer belong to the same company) can only be saved in Salesforce manually using the described above procedures. However, there is also an\nAdmin panel setting\nthat allows saving internal events in Salesforce automatically; you can request that by sending us an email to\nour Support team\n. Additionally, please note that if an events attendees list contains only unresolved email addresses (ones having no Salesforce records associations), this event can only be saved in Salesforce after you\ncreate\nat least one corresponding contact association in Salesforce",

        "page_content": "Meetings Sync Common Scenarios\nThe patterns of meetings saving in Salesforce vary in different situations depending on what kind of meeting participants are involved. Some of the common scenarios are described below:\n1.\nThe meeting organizer is an internal user (a user that belongs to your Salesforce org), i.e. a colleague from your organization. You are among the attendees, you have accepted the meeting and your meeting auto-saving is enabled; the organizers meeting auto-saving is not enabled. In this case the meeting will not be saved in your Salesforce until the organizer either saves the meeting in Salesforce manually, e.g. by assigning it the Salesforce category, or enables auto-saving. The corresponding waiting for the organizer to synchronize the event notification will be displayed in\nDashboard Issues > Events\n2.\nYou are the meeting organizer. The meeting will be saved in Salesforce for you and for those of the attendees who are internal Salesforce users only if your meeting auto-saving is enabled or you have saved the meeting manually. In Salesforce, the corresponding event object will be linked to associated records of the attendees which are external contacts\n3.\nThe meeting organizer is not an internal Salesforce user (e.g. a colleague or contact that does not belong to your Salesforce org). In this case all meeting attendees which are internal users and enabled the auto-saving setting or saved the meeting manually will get the received appointment saved in Salesforce as its owners. It will be saved as an event Salesforce object linked to the relevant records of all external contacts involved (the organizer and some of the attendees).\nThis way, the event object will be linked to relevant records of all external contact attendees for as many times as many meeting participants which are internal Salesforce users (auto-)save the meeting, each of them indicated as the owner of this meeting. However, it remains the same single event object, since the meeting has one single MS Outlook GUID.\nAn example to clarify the scenario #3\nFor instance, there are four persons involved in the meeting:\nIU1\n: an internal Salesforce user with meetings auto-saving enabled\nIU2\n: another internal Salesforce, this one with event sync filters turned on but meetings auto-saving disabled\nEU1\n: an external contact already registered in your Salesforce CRM\nEU2\n: an external contact not yet registered in your Salesforce CRM\nEU1\nis the meeting organizer.\nEU2\n,\nIU1\n, and\nIU2\nare the attendees. In this case\nIU1\ns contact will be linked and added to the Activity History for\nEU1\n.\nIU1\nwill be set as the meetings assignee in Salesforce. The attendees wont be shown. In the default RG Email Sidebar configuration, the initial description from MS Outlook will be used in the events detailed view: From:\nEU1\nand To/CC:\nEU2\n,\nIU1\n,\nIU2\n.\nIf\nIU2\nsaves the meeting in Salesforce by assigning it the Salesforce category in MS Outlook, Revenue Grid sync will create the meeting in the Activity History for\nEU1\n. In this case\nIU2\nwill be set as the events assignee in Salesforce.\nEssentially, this way this event (with its specific MS Outlook GUID) will be duplicated. This is expected behavior, since sync is performing its regular patterns. At this point it is expected from\nIU1\nand\nIU2\nto negotiate who is going to be will be the events ultimate assignee, since there may be many attendees.",

There you need to select the Task or EmailMessage object type respectively, and then in the objects Detailed view mark the fields you want to edit via the dialog as\nImportant\nor\nRequired\nIn addition, if\nAutomatic Saving of Email Threads\nis enabled in your\nRGES Sync settings\n, you can select the\nAuto-save new emails within this thread\ncheckbox at the bottom of the dialog to get all future emails from/to this correspondent saved in Salesforce automatically, without your involvement.\nAfter populating all necessary fields, click the\nSave\nbutton in the upper right corner of the dialog to save the email in Salesforce. Please note that RGES passes the special values from email fields populated by the users in Save dialog to all subsequent synced emails, i.e., whatever the user selected for the first email will be the same for all new emails in a thread.\nWhen the email is successfully saved in Salesforce, a success toast notification pops up, signaling that the email was saved in Salesforce and (linked to)\n{number of related records}\nother objects. Besides, after the email is saved, it will be assigned the blue\nSalesforce\ncategory in MS Outlook.\nIf\nRGES synchronization\nis active, the user-side differences between saving messages in Read mode and Compose mode is the kind of notification you will get (see the screenshots above) and the fact that messages opened in Compose mode will be saved in Salesforce on the following sync session (within 1-30 minutes), unlike messages opened in Read mode, which are saved immediately.\nThe Salesforce object created when saving an email is logged in RG Email Sidebar\nPast activities\nunder the tab\nActivity Timeline\nand can be opened in Salesforce directly by clicking the blue\nExpand\nicon next to it.",

One of the key factors to be considered is whether an event has external attendees, as that affects items processing in email client.\nUse case 1: applies both to events which have attendees and ones which have no attendees\nIf you create a calendar item in email client and\nsave it in Salesforce\n, then unassign the Salesforce category from the event in email client: the event will not be removed from Salesforce and the Salesforce category will be automatically reassigned to it on the following\nsync session\n. This behavior is defined by an events handling policy that allows deleting events from Salesforce only if they were deleted from email client, not just unsynced.\nUse case 2: applies to events which have attendees (meetings)\nIf you are an events owner (set in\nthe Assigned To event field\n) and organizer in Salesforce and the event got\nsynchronized\nwith your email client calendar (down-synced) by RG Email Sidebar, and then you delete it in Salesforce: the event will be removed from Salesforce but will remain in email client, the Salesforce category will be unassigned from it. This behavior is determined by a limitation in email client.\nUse case 3: applies to events which have no attendees (appointments)\nIf you create a calendar item in email client and\nsave it in Salesforce\n, then delete it from Salesforce: the event will be removed from Salesforce but will remain in email client, the Salesforce category will be unassigned from it. This behavior is determined by a limitation in email client\nIf you create a calendar item in email client and\nsave it in Salesforce\n, then delete it in email client: the event will be removed from Salesforce as well (up-synced), to maintain one-to-one calendars synchronization\nIf you create a calendar item in email client and\nsave it in Salesforce\n, and then the event anyhow leaves the\nsliding time window covered by sync\n: the Salesforce category will be unassigned from it in email client; no changes made to the event in email client will be reflected in Salesforce. This behavior is defined by the sliding time window mechanism (two weeks in the past from the present date)\nIf you create an event in Salesforce and it gets down-synced to email client, then you unassign the Salesforce category from it in email client: the event will not be removed from Salesforce and the Salesforce category will be automatically reassigned to it on the following\nsync session\n.

        "page_content": "Two Layers of Not-for-syncing Blocklists\nAmong other features, RG Email Sidebar offers automated saving of Exchange/Office 365 Emails,  Meetings/Appointments, and Contacts in Salesforce. To prevent saving of items not intended to be saved in Salesforce, RGES includes two layers of blocklisting based on email address or email domains:\nOrg-wide blocklisting\n(managed via the\nAdmin panel\n). This blocklist is used to exclude spam, newsletters, and other unwanted emails from being saved in Salesforce by the users; internal (in-org) domains and addresses are also appended to it\nUser-defined blocklisting\n(managed via\nindividual Sync settings\n). This blocklist is used to exclude personal communication and meetings/appointments as well as personal newsletters from being saved in Salesforce\nBy default, these blocklists are combined for every individual user and users can remove addresses/domains set on the Admin level from the congregated blocklist.\nAdditionaly, if a company uses several internal email domains (e.g.,\nsuccessteam.com\n,\nsuccess.team\n,\nsuccessteam.io\n), it is impossible to remove these email domains from the blocklist. If admins manually remove any internal email domain in the\nServiceAutoTrackBlackList\nsetting, on refreshing the Settings page, the deleted email domain will be restored in the blocklist. This is the default designed behavior.\nThe same happens when a user removes internal domain(s) from their individual Blocklist in RG Sync Settings, the deleted domain(s) reappear in the Blocklist after some time.\nNote\nPer\ncustomers request\n(option available for Enterprise users only), this behavior can be adjusted so that addresses/domains set by the Admin will be impossible to remove from the blocklist via the users\nindividual Synchronization setting\nNote\nBesides the org-wide and user-defined blocklisting described above, another blocklist feature is configured in RGES. A special global setting blocklists all free email services (e.g.\ngmail.com\n,\nyahoo.com\n, etc.) from\nauto-syncing\nby default.

After you send an email with the tracking code (the Magic Pixel) inserted, the following data is collected and conveyed to you in real-time mode via RGES Engagement Panel:\nDate and time\n(in your timezone) when the email is opened by the recipient(s)\nCountry / state, city\n- approximate geolocation where the email was opened. To see it, you need to hover the cursor over the\nicon\nDevice type\nfrom which the email was opened (desktop or mobile device)\nThe renewed Engagement panel has the following improvements:\nYou can reset the new email opens count indicator on the Engagement panel icon by holding he\nControl (Ctrl)\nkey and double\nleft-clicking\non the icon\nImplemented an additional\nCustomization setting\nthat regulates Engagement notifications displaying for emails to external (not in-org) contacts with auto-inserted tracking code; the settings name is\nNotify when email is opened\n. When it is enabled, the red number indicator in RG Email Sidebars bottom toolbar will be increased when the tracking code is triggered by a recipient of any such email, as if they were marked as Important by the user\nThe feature is now also available in\nRGES for Salesforce and Gmail Chrome Extension\n. The only essential difference is that in the Chrome Extension the only way to add the tracking code is by\nenabling its automatic insertion into all composed emails\nvia RGES Customization settings\nEach email opening is logged in reverse chronological order (the latest openings on top)\nEmail openings data is conveniently organized in the Engagement panel as separate expandable communication threads, in which the new emails you send are also logged\nYou can mark correspondence threads of especial importance by clicking on the\nPin\nicon next to them to view a notification in the Sidebars bottom toolbar on email opening. Note that the refresh rate for these notifications is 5 minutes\nClicking on a thread name in Engagement panel opens the latest email message in this thread\nA search box was implemented on top of Engagement panel, so you can quickly find needed threads by email address, subject, recipients name and surname\nIn addition, in the latest RGES updates you can filter engagement data by time period when the tracking code was triggered, by recipients email domain (company), or by the\nSequence\nor\nStep\nit belongs to in\nRevenue Grid\nImportant\nIf an email containing the tracking code is sent to multiple recipients, there is no technical possibility to detect which one of them opened the email at a specific moment.\nAlso, please note that email openings from your local IP subnet do not get registered in Engagement panel. Therefore, if yourself or colleagues from your office open an email with inserted tracking code, that will not be reflected in the logs.\nThe engagement tracking data for every email open or link click is stored in RGES Engagement panel only for 90 days\nThe feature is based on adding a tiny and secure tracking code snippet into email message bodys html. When the recipients open the message in their email clients, the code is triggered; it collects the opening time, device type, and IP location data and passes this information directly to your RG Email Sidebar Add-In.\nNote\nNote that the Track Email Opens button is only available for emails opened in\nCompose mode",

And when the prospect A opens the email thread once again, that be counted as a new engagement update, with a corresponding notification\nThe count will increase to 2 or 3 only if engagement updates are registered in other pinned threads, with the prospects B and C\nThis functionality allows RGES users to actively monitor engagement updates in real time for the most important threads; the delay between tracking code triggering by a recipient and notification appearance on the Engagement panel is around 5 minutes.\nAt that, note that network restrictions on the recipients side may block the tracking codes callbacks, thus making precise engagement tracking impossible for some recipients.

        "page_content": "Revenue Grid Synchronization Engine: An Overview\nThe core data synchronization\nprocess\ndescribed in this article is not to be confused with the toggleable RG Email Sidebar\nfeatures\nauto-syncing of every new inbound or outbound\nemail\nor\ncalendar item\n, or\nauto-saving of new emails in specific threads\n. Those features are carried out by this process and if synchronization is not\nset up\nor\nis suspended\n, these features will not work. Refer to\nthis comparison article\nto learn about the scope of functions performed by the Sync Engine and the\nAdd-In\n(or the\nChrome Extension\n).\nRevenue Grid Synchronization (RGES Sync Engine) is a recurrent background (server-side) process of two-way data exchange between your email account (on an MS Exchange, Office 365, or Gmail server) and your Salesforce account, that RG Email Sidebar performs 24/7 to maintain data mirroring between your email/calendar items and their matching Salesforce objects, also considering your choices and actions in RG Email Sidebar and your email client (via the\ndedicated category or folder\n). RGES Sync does\nnot\ndepend on whether\nRG Email Sidebar Add-In\nis opened in your email client. Sync data is transferred securely server-to-server:\nover\nEWS\nfor MS Exchange or Office 365 with Exchange Online\nover\nMS Graph\nfor Office 365 with Exchange Online\nover\nTLS\n/\nSSL\nfor Gmail\nover official secure\nSalesforce API\nto/from your Salesforce account.\nBy default, RGES Sync sessions are carried out every 30 minutes; they run regardless of whether RG Email Sidebar or MS Outlook/other supported email client is opened or not, as server-to-server data exchange unnoticed by the users.\nSince data exchange is carried out between your email server and Salesforce server while your local email client and the Sidebar only serve to display email / calendar data and register your choices and actions, RGES Sync does not consume any noticeable amount of your local internet traffic.\nThe users have the possibility to differentiate between emails they saved via the Save button (\nRead and Compose modes\n) and ones auto-saved by RGES Sync engine; the former are marked via a custom Salesforce field\nAddInEmail\nwhich is added by the advanced\nSalesforce integration Revenue Grid managed package\n.\nThe key aspects of synchronization process can be flexibly adjusted by the end users individually via\nSync dashboard\nand\nRG Email Sidebar Customization page\n, or by the local admin via\nAdmin settings\n. Synchronization can be\nmanually suspended or forced to run sooner than the next scheduled session\n. It may also get suspended due to errors and\nmonitored for troubleshooting\n.\nMaintaining data mirroring is based on\ntables of matching fields\nmapped between MS Exchange / Office 365 calendar items/tasks/contacts and corresponding Salesforce objects. These mapping tables are used to compare the values in matching fields and transfer updated values from email server to Salesforce or vice versa, replacing old values in corresponding fields with actual ones.\nThis ongoing data mirroring process has its\nspecific exceptions and overriding patterns\napplied in certain cases as required by convenience of use considerations, e.g. for processing\nevent attendees lists\n. In addition, refer to\nthis article\nfor in-depth explanations of specific calendars sync exceptions. Finally, there are\ncustom sync adjustment options\nwhich alter the reciprocal mirroring principle according to customers preferences.\nNote\nUnlike continuous\nmirror-syncing\nof MS Exchange / Office 365 or\nGmail\nTasks, Contacts, or calendar items,\nsaving of emails\nis always a\none-way\nMail server  Salesforce process by definition. In addition, it is performed only one time for each saved email, except for the special case of\nEnhanced Emails editing\nBesides this core data mirroring process, synchronization sessions involve several related jobs: checking for emails / events / tasks / contacts assigned Salesforce category or put into Salesforce folder, creation of Salesforce objects based on new emails or calendar items and user input,\nfinding and linking of related records\nin Salesforce, deletion of the matching object if\nthe configuration requires that\n(for example, removal from Salesforce of a meeting that got cancelled in Exchange/Office 365).\nNote\nNote that in the latest RG Email Sidebar updates, resetting/reapplying\nCustomization settings\ndoes not affect calendar items synchronization in any way\nImportant\nSome actions can only be performed via Sync Engine:\ncalendar items syncing\nin Salesforce,\nsaving of email messages in Compose mode\n, saving of emails, contacts, or tasks by\nassigning them the\nSalesforce\ncategory or moving emails to the\nSalesforce emails\nfolder\n. Note that because of the sync sessions interval it may take up to 30 minutes for a corresponding item to appear in Salesforce after your performed either of these saving actions.\nSeveral other actions involving creation or updating of Salesforce items do\nnot\ndepend on the Sync Engine, since they are performed by\nRGES Add-In\nimmediately in Salesforce. That includes\nsaving email messages using the Save button in Read mode\nor initial saving (creation) of calendar items in Salesforce. See\nthis comparison table\nfor complete information\nTip\nBesides\nregular synchronization settings\nRG Email Sidebar offers special adjustments to meet your companys specific preferences -\nsyncing calendar items as other object types besides events\nand\none-way synchronization options",

If an Account with exact\nCompany\nfield matching is found - the Account is used for Contact linking. In case there are several Accounts found, one with the earliest creation date is used\n3. If there is no direct match, the\nCompany\nfields value is searched for among sub-strings of Account names in Salesforce, and if there is only one matching Account found, it is used to link the Contact to. If no relevant Account is found this way, see point\n4\n4. If no matches with the\nCompany\nfields value are found among Account names in Salesforce, a Contact with empty Account association is attempted to be created in Salesforce\nTip\nIn case you want to adjust the Contacts processing mechanisms to meet your companys specific preferences: by adding extra required fields, changing default values in some fields, ensuring auto-linking to a specific Account, etc., please send a corresponding configuration request to\nour Support team\n, describing your preferences in detail\nContact updates syncing\nWhen a Contact located in the\nSalesforce Contacts\nfolder in MS Outlook is modified, these changes are conveyed (up-synced) to its matching Salesforce Contact object on the following sync session.

This article explains these mechanisms.\nAllow creating email duplicates in Salesforce\nThis setting is located in the\nEmail saving settings\narea of RG Email Sidebar\nCustomization settings\nand it is enabled by default. It can be disabled if that is required by your Salesforce use preferences  specifically if you want no Task/Email message duplicates (clones) to be created in your Salesforce.\nSalesforce has a\nlimitation\non\nWhoId linking\n: any Activity can be linked to only one object, so in order to get a\nTask\nor\nEmail Message\nbased on your email correspondence linked to multiple objects RG Email Sidebar must create its duplicates (clones) in Salesforce. This is the default behavior preferred by most RG Email Sidebar users; if you disable this setting to prevent creation of Activity clones in Salesforce, linking of emails to multiple objects will become unavailable: if you link an Email already linked to an object to another object, the first object will be unlinked.\nOn modifying the emails primary association you will be prompted to replace the current value in the\nName\nfield of an already existing Task/Email message with the name of the new object you want to associate the email with. For example, if you first save an email linked to a Contact and then try to save it linked a Lead (in this case, Robert West), you will see the following notification:\nAdditionally, you can adjust the related setting\nAllow creating email duplicates to be linked to these object types\nto set what object types Task/Email message duplicates are allowed to be created for, instead of disabling creation of duplicated Activities altogether. If you define this limit, less Activity duplicates will be created in Salesforce. The maximum number of clones that an email can have in this scenario is 10.\nNote\nIf the\nAllow creating email duplicates to be linked to these object types\nlist is left empty, RG Email Sidebar will be allowed to create Task or Email message duplicates for linking to all Salesforce object types\nImportant\nPlease note that if you adjust the duplicate handling settings in RG Email Sidebar Customization, for these changes to be applied you must\nlog out from RG Email Sidebar\nand then\nre-log in",

This mechanism makes retrieval of needed data from standard as well as\ncustom added fields\nconvenient and flexible, thus unlocking implementation of various custom solutions for smart target Salesforce data displaying or appending to items fields shown in MS Outlook.\nNote\nRetrieval of smart description fields values works only\none-way\n, from Salesforce to MS Exchange / Office 365 or Gmail, thus any changes you may make in a text field containing smart description data in your email client will\nnot\nbe up-synced to Salesforce and will be overwritten on the following sync session, replaced by the fields content fetched from Salesforce afresh\nAn example of the Smart Description feature application is automatic appending a Contacts\nphone number\n,\nposition\n,\norganizations address\n, or any details contained in a Contacts standard or custom fields, to the Description of a Meeting scheduled with this Contact, to make it more informative and thus faster to process.\nThe following delimiter is used to separate appended smart description data from the fields original content:\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nA sample MS Outlook meeting with appended smart description data from Salesforce:\nImportant\nPlease note that when some informative Smart description details are appended to a meetings Description, they may also be seen by the corresponding Meetings attendees, including the external ones, e.g. the customers, so be considerate about what sensitive information can be included in an Events Smart description. See\nthis article\nfor more details\nSimilarly, a Tasks or Contacts fields filling in MS Outlook or Gmail can be enhanced by automatic addition of extra details contained in any relevant objects standard or custom fields, while their Notes field can be used by RGES Sync for target Salesforce data displaying according to end users preferences, in addition to what is displayed in the\nAdd-In (Sidebar)\n.\nTo enable the Smart Description feature for your Org,\ncontact us\nwith a corresponding request specifying:\nobject fields which you want to retrieve data from\ntarget text fields to which it should be added\nWas this article helpful?\nYes\nNo\nGet back to us\nWe would love to hear from you!\nName:\nE-mail:\nComment:",

That is, if an object is modified on either side, these changes are conveyed to the other side so the items remain identical.\nHowever, to meet the customers specific preferences, in the latest RG Email Sidebar updates advanced one-way synchronization options were introduced for calendar items. Previously, one-way syncing was used in some custom configurations to make events read-only on the Salesforce side (set as single source of truth)  that is, non-modifiable by\nRevenue Grid synchronization\nwhen changes were made to their matching objects in MS Exchange.\nNote\nPlease note that presently this feature is available by request sent at to\nour Support team\nincluding a detailed description of your specific use preferences\n1. Mail server  Salesforce upsyncing\nWith this feature enabled, changes (modification, deletion) made to events through your email client and RG Email Sidebar will override any changes made to them directly in Salesforce. You can make use of this feature if, for example, if you do not manage events through Salesforce. With this setting enabled, any changes made to records in Salesforce will be replaced with data up-synced from your email client.\nImportant\nNote that events\ncreated\nin Salesforce will be down-synced to your MS Exchange / Office 365/Gmail calendar, but modifications or deletions of events in Salesforce will be reverted on the following sync session. For example, if you create and sync a Salesforce event with MS Exchange / Office 365 and then correct something about it or delete it in Salesforce, your corrections will not be kept. As a workaround you can make the necessary corrections in the corresponding event (or delete and event) in MS Outlook and these changes will be up-synced to Salesforce\n2. Salesforce  Mail server downsycing\nTip\nAlso refer to\nthis article\nto learn how to disable down-syncing for specific item types\nThis option enables one-way transferring of item changes (creation, modification, deletion) from Salesforce to MS Outlook, while event updates made in MS Outlook will\nnot\nbe kept or conveyed to Salesforce. For example, this feature can be used to perform one-way spreading of information about an all-org public event among the employees via Salesforce.\nNote\nProcessing of the one-way updates as well as reverting of changes on either side according to specified priority is carried out on\nRevenue Grid synchronization sessions\n, not instantly\nAdditionally, in the latest RG Email Sidebar updates there is a new\nspecial setting\nthat enables\nauto-sharing\nof only outbound (sent) emails in Salesforce, but not inbound (inbox) ones.\nAlso note that in the latest RGES updates the\nGlobal setting\nServiceEventDeletionStrategy\nwas introduced to make it possible to perform automatic deletion of calendar items from MS Exchange calendar by\nRGES Sync\nif they were deleted from Salesforce calendar by the users.\nWas this article helpful?\nYes\nNo\nGet back to us\nWe would love to hear from you!\nName:\nE-mail:\nComment:",

If you use Experience Cloud site with the\n.force.com\nsite URL, you might experience some login issues. Refer to\nthis article\nto learn more about troubleshooting this issue\nRGES Add-In\nand\nSync engine\nprovide a special possibility to capture CRM data for\nSalesforce Customer / Partner Community environments\nintegrated with different MS Exchange or Google mail instances, i.e. authorized mail servers used by companys partners or customers entitled to access specific segment of a shared CRM environment.\nThis is organized in the same secure and Salesforce config specific manner as for corporate infrastructures which include several dedicated email servers/domains, e.g. ones used by different branches of a company. Each RG backend unit is a multi-tenant entity, hosting multiple company entities as dedicated tenants and end user groups. Within this infrastructure, each tenants and each users data is securely isolated from the rest and no unauthorized data access is possible. On new Customer / Partner Community users provisioning in the system, a HMAC-based server-to-server authentication scheme with request signing via a secret shared between the sender and the recipient is applied, along with protection from replay attacks involving a nonce value and timestamps, ensuring that provisioning requests are performed only by an entitled authorized party and this access is spoofing-proof.\nNo user data or access credentials are consistently stored or anyhow exposed to disclosing within RGES infrastructure, the system leverages Salesforce and Exchange/O365 or Google native data access authorization methods via individual users OAuth and other token types instead of access credentials.\nFor all such scenarios, in-org, different branch, or customer / partner community, users data handling is performed in an isolated targeted manner that always observes the\naccess rules set for individual users or groups of users in Salesforce\n. When a provisioned customer / partner user gets\nserver-side Sync activated\nand\nlogs in to RGES Add-In\n, their access to the shared Salesforce environment is authorized via OAuth 2.0 or\nanother supported mechanism\nand in this environment RGES has the same data viewing and editing permissions scope as the user has when they open their Salesforce account in a browser. A single email account is connected to a single designated Salesforce account and the system ensures that no unauthorized data access, modification, leakage, or hijacking is possible.\nThe data that a customer/partner community user may capture in Salesforce from their MS Exchange mailbox is defined by\nRGESs selective or automated capturing mechanisms\nand\nSync settings\nas well as the actual write/edit permissions on the Salesforce side.\nAlso note that RGES can work with up to 4 email aliases available for configured end users MS Exchange mailbox. See\nthis article\nfor more information.\nThe below diagram illustrates the backend architecture of individual users data processing in the RGES system.",

Campaigns is among custom object types which are present in\nSalesforce set of objects\n, and in their case\nenabling the Campaign object card on RGES Customization page\nalone is not enough to add them to RGES handling scope. The first point to consider is that such objects may have one or more auxiliary related cards, for example a Campaign has associated\nCampaign Member Status\n,\nCampaign Member\n, and\nCampaign Field History\ncards. They contain additional object data, and their absence in RGES processing scope results in primary objects, Campaigns in this case, not being retrieved by\nRGES initial search\n(that is, brought up in\nRelated records lists\nor by\nuser-initiated search\n.\nThis way, when adding a custom object to the processing scope via RGES Customization page, make sure to search for its auxiliary cards, by entering the objects name in the\nQuick Find\nfield of\nCustomization page\ns left pane\nObjects in Salesforce\n, then enable all relevant cards.\nNext, click\nSave\nin the upper right corner of Customization page to apply the changes and\nrefresh the Add-In\n. This should include the object into RG Email Sidebars handling scope (including a\ndedicated tab\nadded for this object type on the home screen), as well as\nuser-initiated search\n.\nII.\nNext, to include the object into the\nRelated records list\n, you should ensure that your\nrelated Business records layout\nin Salesforce is correspondingly configured. Perform the below steps to do that:\n1.\nLog in to your Salesforce account\n2.\nIn Salesforce, open\nSetup\n>\nObject Manager\n>\n{Business record related to the added one, e.g. Contact or Account}\n>\nLightning Record page\n> open the\n{item marked as Org Default}\n>\nEdit\n3.\nTo add a custom object to the Related list of a Business record:\n3.1.\nIn the right hand pane of Business records layout page, click the\nAdd Tab\nbutton under\nRelated\n3.2.\nIn the pages central pane, open the added\nRelated\ntab\n3.3.\nIn the search box of the left hand pane, enter\nrelated\n3.4.\nDrag and drop the\nRelated Lists\nitem found to the\nRelated\ntab into the central pane\n4.\nClick\nSave\nin the top right corner of the layout page to apply the layout changes\n5.\nReapply RGES customization to enable the layout changes; to do that,\nopen Customization page\nand click\nSave\nin its upper right corner. Now the added object should be shown in RGESs Related records list\nIII.\nFinally, to ensure that\nRGES initial search\nretrieves and displays the objects of the added type, you should set a corresponding Salesforce List View in RGESs\nContextual Search\nsetting (which will be otherwise set to Do not search):\n1.\nIf you do not have a corresponding list view for the object in Salesforce,\ncreate a custom Salesforce List View\nfor the object that will include all instances of it\n2.\nSet the created or your existing view in the\nContextual search filter\nfor this object in Customization settings\n3.\nMake sure to apply the changes in Customization by clicking\nSave\nin the upper right corner\nWas this article helpful?\nYes\nNo\nGet back to us\nWe would love to hear from you!\nName:\nE-mail:\nComment:",

Additionally, take into consideration that if too many fields are listed in\nSearch by\n, Salesforce search will take considerably more time to complete, so it is recommended to limit their number to as few as possible (10 fields being the tentative maximum)\nRG Email Sidebar features the possibility to\nSearch by\nthe object type using the object type selector in the RGES global search.\nTip\nOne more feature avaliable in RG Email Sidebar is the\nSearch by\ncombination of tags (maximum 5 tags at once). After at least 3 characters are entered, on Enter button pressing, the keyword is added as a search tag. The keyword may include spaces",

This simplifies search value entry  instead of entering both name and surname into the search box (exact value search is used) you will need to enter only either one of them.\nAnother common best-use practice (requires Salesforce admin permissions to set up):\ncreate in Salesforce\n(if it did not exist in your customization) a custom\n2nd Email\nfield for your email correspondent record types that will store the interlocutors secondary (personal) email address, then include the field in\nSearch by\n.\nSecondary addresses are often used in communication besides the primary (business) ones and, since\nSearch by\nalso defines\nRG Email Sidebar initial search process\n, this will allow messages received from the secondary address to be properly processed and associated in Salesforce. This is the most convenient way to deal with messages incoming from secondary addresses, however, if creating in Salesforce and populating the\n2nd Email\nfield for new records is not an option for you, you can find the relevant objects using\nRG Email Sidebar search\nand link them manually.\nWas this article helpful?\nYes\nNo\nGet back to us\nWe would love to hear from you!\nName:\nE-mail:\nComment:",

To determine which type is used for storing attachments in your Org, see\nthis Forcetalk thread\n.\nDepending on what kind of object is used for storing attachments in your Salesforce, to set up attachment saving via RG Email Sidebar you need to enable the respective object in the central column\nObjects in RG Email Sidebar\non Customization page.\nTo set up attachments setting via RG Email Sidebar, open Customization page, find the\nContent document (File)\nor\nAttachment\ntype in the left pane\nObjects in Salesforce\nand select the checkbox next to it.

Other options should be considered if specific security requirements prohibit Multi-tenant operation in your Org\nIP Address restrictions: RG Email Sidebar operates via a fixed set of IP addresses\nThe customers using corporate firewall IP address restrictions for Salesforce or MS Exchange servers connection need to allow-list specific IP addresses used by RG Email Sidebar.\nSuch whitelisting is complementary, it does not block any existing server traffic\nSee more details on configuring IP restrictions and the list of IP addresses used in Multi-tenant environments\nhere\nFor Single-tenant configurations a specific list is communicated during RG Email Sidebar deployment\nAs a best practice, such configuration should be added over the current customer configuration, to prevent interfering with existing traffic\nFiltering RG Email Sidebar EWS traffic RG Email Sidebar\nFiltering can be configured to use a pre-set UserAgent header on every EWS call made to the customers MS Exchange server. Such configuration allows traffic filtering on multiple levels:\nOn MS Exchange / Office 365 side: using MS Exchange controls, as documented\nhere\nThis configuration control allows additive listing of allow-listed applications, and if used by in a customers Org it may be extended to include traffic from/to RG Email Sidebar\nBy a stateful firewall which can block HTTPS traffic\nAs in the above case, a custom rule can be built based on an added UserAgent HTTP header to allow RG Email Sidebar-originated EWS traffic pass through, in addition to any other allowed traffic\nThe value of the UserAgent header for all EWS traffic can be set as requested by a customer\nAs a best practice, customers who already implemented EWS traffic filtering using one of the above approaches should consider extending their configuration to allow RG Email Sidebar EWS traffic",

You can use the\nNew-ManagementRoleAssignment\nExchange Management Shell cmdlet to assign the\nApplicationImpersonation\nrole to users in the organization.\nTip\nAlso refer to\nthis Microsoft help\narticle for complete information on account Roles\nWhen you assign the\nApplicationImpersonation\nrole, use the following parameters of the\nNew-ManagementRoleAssignment\ncmdlet:\nName\n- The friendly name of the role assignment. Each time you assign a role, an entry is made in the RBAC roles list. You can verify role assignments by using the Get-ManagementRoleAssignment cmdlet.\nRole\n- The RBAC role to assign. When you set up Exchange Impersonation, you assign the ApplicationImpersonation role.\nUser\n- The impersonating mail account.\nCustomRecipientScope\n- The scope of users that the impersonating user can impersonate. The impersonating user will only be allowed to impersonate other users within a specified scope. If no scope is specified, the user is granted the ApplicationImpersonation role over all users in an organization. You can create custom management scopes using the New-ManagementScope cmdlet.\nTo configure Exchange Impersonation for a\nshared mailbox\n(aliases)\n1.\nCreate a\nshared mailbox\n. If there is already a shared mailbox in your Exchange, skip this step\n2.\nOpen\nExchange Management Shell\n3.\nRun the\nNew-ManagementScope\ncmdlet\nto create a scope for which the impersonation role should be assigned. If the scope was set earlier, you can skip this step. The following example shows how to create a management scope for a specific group; you can create ManagementScope only via PowerShell.\nNew-ManagementScope -Name:scopeName -RecipientRestrictionFilter:{Recipients Filter}\nThe\nRecipientRestrictionFilter\nparameter of the\nNew-ManagementScope\ncmdlet\ndefines the mailboxes in the scope. You can use properties of the\nIdentity\nobject to create the filter.\nThe following command is used to set a filter that defines the scope of mailbox aliases beginning with sharedmail:\nNew-ManagementScope -Name SharedScopeAlias -RecipientRestrictionFilter {email alias, e.g. 'sharedmail*'}\n4.\nRun the\nNew-ManagementRoleAssignment\ncmdlet\nto add the impersonating permissions for the mailboxes within the scope set at step (\n3\n). The following command is used to enable the service account to impersonate all users in this scope\nNew-ManagementRoleAssignment -Name:{Impersonation Assignment Name} -Role:ApplicationImpersonation -User:{Service Account} -CustomRecipientWriteScope:{Scope Name}\nFor example:\nNew-ManagementRoleAssignment Name \"impersonation\" Role:ApplicationImpersonation User \"ImpersonatedAcc\" CustomRecipientWriteScope \"SharedScopeAlias\"\nAlternatively, if your\nRG Email Sidebar deployment scenario\nrequires that, you can assign the Impersonation service account for all user accounts. To do that:\nRun the\nNew-ManagementRoleAssignment\ncmdlet\nto add impersonating permissions to the specified mail account. The following command is used to configure Exchange Impersonation enabling a service account to impersonate\nall\nusers in an Org:\nNew-ManagementRoleAssignment -Name:{impersonationAssignmentName} -Role:ApplicationImpersonation -User:{ServiceAccount}\nFor example:\nNew-ManagementRoleAssignment -Name \"impersonationrole\" -Role:ApplicationImpersonation -User \"ImpersonatingAcc\"",

The Extension can be\ninstalled individually\nor mass-deployed for all end users by the local mail server Admin.\nThis article describes the mass deployment scenario where the local mail server Admin installs the\nRGES for Gmail and Salesforce Chrome Extension\nfor all RGES end users in an Org. It is a standard secure\nChrome browser extension\nreviewed by Google, and in the enterprise environment it can be mass-deployed for multiple end users using\nMicrosoft Group Policy\nmechanisms. This Chrome Extension mass deployment method is only viable in Windows systems,\nWindows Active Directory\nenvironment.\nThe alternative method for non-Windows systems uses Googles native mechanisms which ensure automatic Extensions installation in Chrome browser after that was enforced for logged in Google accounts by Google Workplace Admin. See\nthis Google article\nfor complete information.\nBesides Extension installation, mass RG Email Sidebar for Gmail deployment requires mass Sync activation via a Service account. See\nthis article\nto learn how to do that.\nTo mass-deploy the Chrome Extension using Active Directory, follow the instruction below (based on the\nguidelines\ndeveloped by\nDennis Span\n).\nRG Email Sidebar Extension deployment string to be used (\nfast prod build\ninstallation):\nagfekjndkedoakoeahndfnjilkifbicn;https://clients2.google.com/service/update2/crx\n1.\nImport the\nGoogle Chrome ADMX files\ninto your\nActive Directory environment\nThe described method to mass-deploy Chrome extensions is through\nMicrosoft Group Policy\n. As per\nGoogle\n:\nFor Windows, it is recommended to use Group Policy vs. preferences  files because only Group Policy can be enforced\n. An identical statement is  made in the\nChrome Deployment Guide\n:\nUse Windows Group Policies (GPO policies) and cloud policy over preferences when possible. Unlike policies, preferences do not apply to  previous installations of Chrome and are only applied to a single  profile. Policies also override any preferences settings for a feature. Also note that the master_preferences file can be changed and not enforced like group policies can\n.\nGoogle\nprovides official ADM and ADMX files\nwhich enable the end users to manage its products. For RGES Extension mass deployment, we recommend you to use the\nADMX files\nonly and not the ADM files. Before you can use Microsoft Group Policies to mass-deploy the Extension, you first need to import the Google Chrome ADMX files in your\nGroup Policy Central Store\n.\nThe ADMX files, as well as the ADM language files, (\n.ADML\n) can be found in the directory\nConfiguration\\admx* of the extracted\nChrome Enterprise Bundle\narchive.\nIf you are not familiar with the Central Store for Group Policies and require more detailed information, refer to the official Microsoft article\nHow to create and manage the Central Store for Group Policy Administrative Templates in Windows\n.\nChrome Enterprise Bundle includes the following six ADMX files:\nchrome.admx\nChromeUASwitcher.admx\ngoogle.admx\nGoogleUpdate.admx\nLegacyBrowserSupport.admx\nPasswordAlert.admx\nThe purposes of most of these ADMX files are self-explanatory, except for the ADMX file\ngoogle.admx\n. This file only has one purpose, which is to set the shared\nGoogle\nfolder in the\nGroup Policy editor\n. This folder ensures that all Google policy settings (for the Chrome browser or other Google products) are grouped under one folder.\nThe Group Policy Central Store is located on your\ndomain controllers\n.\nThe Central Store root path (containing the ADMX files):\n\\\\%LogonServer%\\sysvol\\\n#DomainName#\n\\Policies\\PolicyDefinitions\nThe ADMX files are put in the root of the Store; the language files (*\n.ADML\n), are put in the language-specific subdirectories.\nCentral Store subdirectories for the language files:\n\\\\%LogonServer%\\sysvol\\\n#DomainName#\n\\Policies\\PolicyDefinitions\\\n#languagecode-countrycode#\nCopy the Chrome ADMX files into this folder:\nCopy the English language\n.ADML\nfiles into the en-US folder:\nNote\nThe 2021 updates of RG Email Sidebar also include support for several more languages; make sure to copy non-English ADML files for the supported language(s) you will use into their corresponding directories. The\ncorrect directory name for your language\ncan be found in\nConfiguration\\admx\nof the unarchived\nChrome Enterprise Bundle\nNow that you have copied all required files, you can start configuring your settings using a Group Policy editor (such as\nGroup Policy Management Console\n).\nIn case you do not want to update your Central Store right away, you can first perform some tests by using the local ADMX repository on a server. The local repository of a Windows server is located here:\nC:\\Windows\\PolicyDefinitions\n. Apply the same procedure for copying the ADMX and ADML files as for the Central Store. Use the local Group Policy editor to configure your settings (\ngpedit.msc\n).\nImportant\nThe future versions of Chrome will feature updated .ADMX and .ADML files included into\nChrome Enterprise Bundle\n. Please remember that your Group Policy settings are\nnot\naffected when you update the .ADMX files. Your settings are kept in different files within each individual Group Policy itself:\nRegistry.pol\ncontains the Group Policy settings;\n.xml\n(e.g.\nFiles.xml*) contains your Group Policy preferences settings\nThe path to an individual group policy is as follows:\n\\\\%LogonServer%\\sysvol\\\n#DomainName#\n\\Policies\\\n#PolicyGUID#\nAfter configuring your Chrome settings you can check if your Chrome policies are applied by entering\nchrome://policy\nin Chrome address bar. This will show you all Chrome settings applied for your PC and user.\nUser settings can be either mandatory or recommended. Mandatory user settings are configured here:\nUser Configuration \\ Administrative Templates \\ Google \\ Google Chrome\nRecommended user settings are configured here:\nUser Configuration \\ Administrative Templates \\ Google \\ Google Chrome - Default Settings (users can override)\nOn the local server or client, Chromes computer and user policies are stored in the following\nregistry keys\n:\nHKEY_CURRENT_USER \\ SOFTWARE \\ Policies \\ Google \\ Chrome\nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE \\ SOFTWARE \\ Policies \\ Google \\ Chrome\n2.\nTo force-install RGES for Salesforce and Gmail Chrome Extension, open your\nGroup Policy Management Console\n(dsa.msc) and go to\nUser Configuration > Administrative Templates > Google > Google Chrome > Extensions\n. Fine the setting\nConfigure the list of force-installed apps and extensions\nand enable it.\nClick\nShow\nand enter the string we provided at the beginning of the article into the Value field:\nagfekjndkedoakoeahndfnjilkifbicn;https://clients2.google.com/service/update2/crx\nNow the policy setting is configured. On the next Group Policy refresh the users will automatically get the required extension. To summarize, this policy update will mass-deploy the Extension for all users to whom the Group Policy applies. Extension installation is performed silently, without user interaction.\nAs mentioned above, after the Extension has been mass-deployed, you can see it in the directory on the users PCs\nC:\\Users\\%UserName%\\AppData\\Local\\Google\\Chrome\\User Data\\Default\\Extensions\n!!! note Note\nMake sure that\nDeveloper mode\nis disabled on the Extensions tab of users Chrome browsers. During the tests, Extensions were not automatically installed with Developer mode enabled",

If you need to preset individual sync settings to different users in the Profile, send us a corresponding request to\nour Support team\n.\nAuto-saving of emails\nWith this setting enabled users can get all relevant (see point\n5\nin\nthis article\n) incoming and outgoing email messages (\nInbox\nand\nSent\nfolders) automatically saved in Salesforce. With automatic saving enabled, users email messages will be automatically saved as Salesforce Tasks or\nEmail messages\nlinked to related Contacts, Leads, and other Salesforce objects retrieved according to\nthese principles\n. Emails autosaving is performed not immediately but on the following\nsynchronization session\n.\nAuto-saving of events\nUsers can have all their incoming and outgoing Calendar items automatically synced in Salesforce, with specific exceptions listed in\nthis article\n. Note that Revenue Grid will also auto-create new Salesforce records to sync meetings which involve new business contact, see\nthis article\nto learn the details.\nWith automatic meetings syncing enabled, the meetings will be automatically synced up to users Salesforce calendar and also to the calendars of their colleagues who use Revenue Grid, if they were invited.\nAuto-saving of appointments\nWith automatic syncing of appointments enabled, users appointments will be automatically synced with their Salesforce calendar. To enable automatic saving of appointments, toggle the\nAuto-save appointments\nswitch button.\nLinking to Opportunities\nUsers can have their emails associated not only with Contacts and Leads, but also with related Opportunities, saved to Salesforce. These related Opportunities must satisfy all of the following requirements:\nUser is the owner of the Opportunity\nThe account associated with the Opportunity contains a contact of the person whose email address is specified in the From, To, or CC fields\nIf several Opportunities satisfy these requirements, the email will be saved to the most recent one. If such an Opportunity was not found, the email will be saved to the Account that is associated with the related Contact. However, if neither an Opportunity nor an associated Account were found, the email will not be saved at all. This setting applies only to automatic email/event saving, not to manual saving of events/emails.\nBlocklisting emails and domains from syncing\nRevenue Grid offers the possibility to\nblocklist\nemail messages and calendar items from/to certain addresses or domains from being saved with Salesforce (e.g., private contacts or in-org ones).\nNote that a special global setting blocklists all free email services (e.g.,\ngmail.com\n,\noutlook.com\n, etc.) from syncing by default, so you dont need to add all of them to the Blocklist. To change or customize this setting, contact our\nsupport team\n.\nSee\nthis article\nfor more information on\nBlocklisting Email Addresses and Domains\nwith RG Email Sidebar.\nMessage deduplication\nWith this switch button enabled, RG Sync Engine will prevent users from saving an email message which has already been saved by another user. This mechanism ensures that no excessive duplicates are created in Salesforce.\nEmail deduplication field\nThis field is related to the Message deduplication setting described above, it is automatically prefilled with the\nREVGRD__InternetMessageId__c\nvalue, the name of the custom field added by Revenue Grid Salesforce managed package (if its installed). However, admins can specify here another custom field name which will be used for emails deduplication.\nEmail direction field (name)\nIn this field admins can specify custom field for storing Email directions (whether an email message is inbound or outbound). For example,\nDirection_c\nEnable/disable email threads auto-sharing\nEnable/disable automatic saving of all emails which belong to a correspondence thread in Salesforce. There is the\ncorresponding synchronization setting on the user-level\n.\nThread Id field\nThis field is related to the\nEnable/disable email threads auto-sharing setting\ndescribed above; it is used for automatic saving of emails by the conversation identifier. To enable this feature, specify the name of the custom Salesforce field which contains the conversation identifier in this field.\nThis setting is required if email messages are saved as\nTask\n. If emails are saved as EmailMessage, leave this field empty (\nEmailMessage\nwill contain a\nThreadIdentifier\nfield by default).",

Some companies require that in order to get meetings registered in Salesforce even if they were not explicitly accepted.

Note that popular personal email domains (\ngmail.com\n,\noutlook.com\n, etc.) are excluded from this pattern: no Contacts are auto-created for meetings sent or received from addresses on these domains.\nIf the\nCreate Person accounts\nsetting is enabled in\nRGES global settings\n, Person accounts are created instead of Contacts. If theres no Account match found to create a Contact and Create Person accounts is disabled, then a Lead is created.\nAnd another added augmented\nobjects auto-resolving mechanism\nis available, managed by the\nglobal setting\nSalesforceEmailCreateAllUnresolvedRecipients\n(disabled by default). How this pattern works: if enabled, Accounts and Leads/Contacts are created for\nall\nauto-saved incoming and outgoing emails for which no matching\nPerson/Business records\nare found in Salesforce.\nSalesforceEventAutoTrackIncludingNotShared\n(0 = disabled, disabled by default). By default, to be saveable in Salesforce an MS Outlook Meeting or Gmail event must have at least one relevant\nBusiness or People record\nto link it to.

Also see\nthis article\nfor to learn how the blocklist and other filters get applied.\nAvailable auto-track modes:\n0 - General\n(default value)\nEmails get auto-saved if at least one recipients email address is already saved as a People Record in Salesforce. If there is no corresponding record found, the email will NOT be saved to Salesforce\n1 - Forced\nEmails get auto-saved in the\nShareForce\nmode, if at least one recipient is NOT blocklisted (internal employees email addresses are blocklisted as well). If no record is found for the email to be saved to, RGES will\ncreate a new People Record in Salesforce\n. If all recipients are\nblocklisted and/or are internal employees\n, the email will NOT be saved to Salesforce\n2 - Smart\nEmails get auto-saved, even if NO recipients email addresses are saved as People Records in Salesforce. RGES performs a search among Salesforce objects by unresolved emails domains. If any Salesforce object with a matching email domain address is found, RG Email Sidebar creates a new object linked to the found one and saves the email.\nRGES excludes free email services domains (e.g. gmail.com, yahoo.com, etc.) from the search and sync.

If the email can be linked with any Business Record, it will get auto-saved\nONLY\nif at least one recipients email address is NOT blocklisted and is saved as People Record in Salesforce,  or if an auto-created independent\nBusiness Record\ngets linked. The latter case implies one of the following: 1. object reference links were found in email body or 2. reference links were found and email thread got identified by conversation text.\nThis pattern ensures disabling of email auto-saving in case all email addresses in a new incoming or outgoing email are\nblocklisted or internal\n, although a business object was captured in the email.\n4 - Flexible\nEmails get auto-saved, if at least one recipients email address is NOT blocklisted and is not saved as a People Record in Salesforce.

If sync is not running for the Organizer, RG Email Sidebar will not be able to save the item created or modified by the Delegate in Salesforce. The corresponding error notification will be displayed that sync is not enabled for the Organizer\nOnce the corresponding Salesforce event record has been created, its further updates and modifications can be performed directly from via the Organizers or Delegates RG Email Sidebar Add-In; the changes will be conveyed immediately and will not depend on the sync interval. This way, even if sync is not running for the calendar item Organizer, saving changes to an already existing Salesforce event object can be performed if the Delegate has the permissions to access this event in Salesforce\nIf the Delegate does not have the permissions to view the corresponding Salesforce event (however, the Add-In can still obtain the Salesforce event ID from MS Exchange), saving will not be allowed with an error notification that the user has insufficient Salesforce account permissions to save this event\nNote\nThe same error message is displayed if the event was removed from Salesforce and RG Email Sidebar was unable to down-sync this change to MS Exchange\nIf the Delegate does not have the permissions to modify a corresponding Salesforce event, there will appear an error notification that user has insufficient Salesforce account permissions to update this event, suggesting to contact the Organizer to get the required permissions in Salesforce\nNote\nDelegated calendars also support using the\nSend calendar availability\nand\nSend meeting time slots\nfeatures so the Delegate can generate these links for the Delegators calendar\nDelegated Calendars and RGES Meeting Scheduler\nRG Email Sidebar features\nTime Slots\nor\nCalendar Availability\ncan be used for a Delegated access calendar.

This feature is controlled by serversync setting\nSalesforceEventReadResourceLocation\nwhich enables (1) or disables (default value 0) special location handling for Events. This feature supports only one-way synchronization from MS Exchange to Salesforce. Therefore, all relevant changes in MS Exchange will be reflected in Salesforce after synchronization.\nProceed with the following steps to set up the sync of rooms from the MS Exchange calendar to the Salesforce calendar.\n1. In Admin Panel\n1.1.\nOpen\nRevenue Grid Admin Panel\nand go to the\nSettings\ntab\n1.2.\nFind the following settings and set the value = 1 for each to enable them:\na.\nSalesforceEventLinkResourceLocation\n= 1\nb.\nSalesforceEventReadResourceLocation\n= 1\n2. In MS Exchange\n2.1.\nCheck the list of available rooms in the MS Exchange calendar. To find all available rooms list, you can use the Room Finder in your calendar.

        "page_content": "RG Email Sidebar and Salesforce API Calls Limit\nNote\nIn the latest RG Email Sidebar updates, a new\nglobal setting\nwas introduced to RGES configuration that allows reducing of API calls generated by\nRGES Sync\n. Contact\nRevenue Grid support team\nfor more information about the feature. Note that presently the feature is only available upon request\nRG Email Sidebar interacts with Salesforce by sending user-initiated as well as automatically generated requests to Salesforce servers via\nSalesforce API\n(\nAPI calls\n) and receiving their responses. There is a\nlimitation on the number of incoming API\ncalls Salesforce processes per 24 hours and to prevent this limit being reached by users having a vast amount of Salesforce objects in sync, RG Email Sidebar has a mechanism limiting the amount of Salesforce API calls it sends automatically on\nsynchronization sessions\n.\nIf the internal RG Email Sidebar API calls limit is reached, you will get a throttling error notification\nSalesforce API calls minimal threshold exceeded ({actual %%} with limit of {limit %%}), synchronization will be retried later\non your\nsync dashboard\n; your current sync session will be terminated, and the following sessions sync interval will be progressively increased from 30 minutes to 2.5  4.5  6.5   hours until RG Email Sidebar determines that there are enough Salesforce API calls available; then the regular 30 minute synchronization cycle will be resumed automatically. The\nminimal threshold exceeded\nerror is triggered and Revenue Grid synchronization is semi-suspended well in advance before Salesforce API calls limit is about to be reached, so any other applications generating Salesforce API calls will continue running unaffected.\nImportant\nPlease note that you still can effectively use the RG Email Sidebar Add-In / Chrome Extension to work with Salesforce (e.g.\nsearch or create records\n) and save email messages (but not events) from your email client to Salesforce by\nsaving emails in Salesforce manually from Read mode\nafter synchronization has been suspended due to the daily API calls internal (RG Email Sidebar imposed) limit reached.  But if the overall (Salesforce imposed) API calls limit is reached, no interaction between the Add-In / Chrome Extension and Salesforce is possible\nIn case you are working with a vast amount of Salesforce records daily, or use multiple integrations / customizations and start getting the throttling sync error, you can reduce the amount of API calls by adjusting the following RG Email Sidebar settings defining the sync scope:\nSet\nadditional filters\napplied on Contacts synchronization - syncing several hundred contacts may generate many API calls\nDisable auto-syncing of\ncalendar items\nor\nemails\n- so saving of calendar items and emails will be more selective and require less server-to-server processing\nPossibly completely remove certain unused object types from synchronization by\ntoggling corresponding switches\nIf that does not help, another way to prevent the daily API calls internal limit being reached is to increase your sync interval (by default it is set to one sync session per 30 minutes): less frequent synchronization sessions generate proportionally less API calls. Contact us by email to\nour Support team\nto request that.\nIn addition, if the API calls limit is reached on Salesforce side, considering that the\nstandard limit\nis sufficient for most RG Email Sidebar users, it is recommended that your\nlocal Salesforce admin\ncheck for other applications which also use Salesforce API: perhaps some of the apps which generate Salesforce API calls and are not regularly used can be disabled. That would allot Revenue Grid synchronization more API calls. Salesforce offers a\ntool for overviewing API calls amounts sent by different apps\nthat can be used to allocate API calls among RG Email Sidebar and other apps you are running.",

        "page_content": "Dependency Between Sync Scope / Records Updates Count and the Amount of API Calls Generated\nWhen estimating the daily amount of Salesforce API calls sent by RG Email Sidebar you can take into consideration the following factors:\nA daily amount of up to 1,500 Salesforce API calls (10% of the standard limit in Salesforce) is generated to maintain synchronization and is not involved in conveying records modifications, being idle sync API calls. This amount will be practically the same regardless of the overall amount of records synced in Salesforce (synchronization scope)\nThe scope of records updates carried out on sync sessions may significantly affect the amount of Salesforce API calls sent. Depending on the nature of a record update (e.g. updating several fields of a single record vs. modifying series of recurring events), it may require from 1 to 10 API calls per modification. For your estimates you can assume that on average 3% of all records in Salesforce get updated per 24 hours, and this requires a certain additional amount of API calls to be sent\nTip\nAdditionally, refer to\nthis article\nto learn more about API call monitoring in Salesforce.\nBasic API calls consumption (saving from mailbox to Salesforce)\nThis is the approximate calculation of API calls consumption for a\nstandard\n(\nvanilla\n) configuration. The API calls number may vary significantly if  configuration changes are made or additional features are enabled.\nIn this calculation, email recipients and meeting attendees are already created as records in Salesforce (Contacts or Leads) and the auto-creation of Leads and Contacts is disabled. Two saving methods are considered\nauto-saving\n(by RG Sync Engine) and\nmanual saving\n(using the Save button in the Add-in)\nAPI calls consumption by the basic actions and processes:\nSaving 1 email with 1 attachment sent to 1 recipient\nAutomatically  14\nManually  15\nSaving 1 email with 1 attachment sent to 2 recipients\nAutomatically    14\nManually  15\nSaving 1 calendar calendar item (Appointment) with 1 attendee (who is an Organizer)\nAutomatically  3\nManually  5\nSaving 1 calendar calendar item (Meeting) with 2 attendees (including Organizer)\nAutomatically  6\nManually  6",

Then, if you forward this email to your manager within your internal correspondence, the Salesforce category will also be assigned to this internal email, and, as a result, it will be saved to Salesforce.\nHow to handle the unexpected email synchronization\nCheck and verify that you are using\nOutlook on the web\nor the\nnew Outlook for Mac\nto confirm that the unexpected email saving is caused by updated Outlook behavior.

Note that RG Email Sidebar servers location does\nnot\nnoticeably affect processed email and CRM data transfer speed regardless of the end users location, since their mail servers belong to Microsoft Exchange/Office 365 or Gmail infrastructures and all data transfer is carried out on the server side.\nCopy link to this question\n5. Does the ongoing\nRevenue Grid synchronization\nconsume much Internet traffic?\nSince data exchange is carried out between your email server and Salesforce server while your local email client and the Add-In / Chrome Extension only serve to display data and convey your choices and actions, synchronization does not consume any noticeable amount of your local internet traffic.

I use several email accounts for my business correspondence and I want to connect both of them to my Salesforce account?

Therefore, the above scenario is impossible to implement. For the same reason several Salesforce accounts cannot be connected to a single email account via RGES.\nHowever, if such scenario is required, as a workaround you can set up your email accounts each connected to a separate Salesforce account within the same Org (requires an additional Salesforce and RG Email Sidebar license). The same concerns using\nRGES Chrome Extension for Gmail\n.\nAlso note that RGES can automatically\nrecognize and match different MS Exchange / Office 365 alliases\nused for the same email account.\nCopy link to this question",

My mobile device/workstation sometimes loses Internet connection, can I still use RG Email Sidebar?\nRG Email Sidebar collects user input (selections, actions, fields entry and so on) via their email clients  using the\nAdd-In\nor\nChrome Extension\n, and transferring of that data in real time requires availability of Internet connection.\nAt that,\nRGES Sync engine\nworks on the server side and the mechanisms used for saving items in Salesforce over RGES Sync are more fundamental, based on MS Outlook client  MS Exchange / Office 365 server data transfer. If you save an email or calendar item (also an MS Outlook\nTask\nor\nContact\n) from your email client using the custom Salesforce folder or category, the moment your client gets connected to your mail server this items syncing in Salesforce will be initiated.\nThis way, you can mark items to be saved while offline and as soon as connection becomes available, their syncing will start.

That is how long you want this step to wait before being sent out after completing the previous step.\nIf you add an idle to the step sending, the idle is calculated according to the selected schedule. For example, if your sequence steps are sent only on Mondays, and you have set a 3-day idle for a step, this step will be sent out on the fourth Monday after the previous step.\nBy default, the Schedule idle is set to 0 days and hours. This step will be sent out after the previous step according to the sequence schedule without any delays.\nImmediate follow-up steps\nIf you set the Schedule idle to 0 days but add a delay in hours, this step will be sent out on the same day that the previous step but after the specified delay in hours, irrespective of the selected schedule.\nFor example, lets say your sequence is sent out on Monday-Friday from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m., you have set the 2-hour delay for the step. If the previous step was sent out on Monday, the current step would be sent out with the highest priority after 8 p.m. on that same Monday.\nSuch steps are called\nimmediate follow up\nsteps.\nImportant\nWhen you add schedule idle you must also take into consideration the sending limits that could be configured by your admins.\n4. Select Schedule\nBy default, when you create a new step within a sequence, the sequence schedule is applied to the step that is being created. You can set a custom schedule for specific steps.\nWhen you select another schedule for your step, you can review the schedule details by clicking the\nSchedule details\nbutton.\nAdding Steps with a customized schedule\nThis feature is especially useful if you want to schedule specific step types at specific times. For example, if you would like the Call steps to be scheduled from 8 am to 12 pm, you can create a corresponding schedule and set it for a specific step.\n6.

The recipient will see this: I emailed you on Thursday, but never heard back.\nNote that\nLast step day\nmerge field will work only if the previous step was executed.\nBook me link\nmerge field: Adds personal Book me link to the email. Depending on\nwhose behalf the sequence is being run\n, you can add &lcub;&lcub;Owner BookMe Text&rcub;&rcub; or &lcub;&lcub;Sender BookMe Text&rcub;&rcub;.

It also may work other way around; if a status changes directly in Salesforce, then it gets reflected in Revenue Grid. Custom mapping of Revenue Grid statuses to Salesforce depends on each companys needs and business flow.\nHere is an example how it works\nLet's say you mapped an additional field (Rating) and its value (Warm), to the \"Approaching\" status.\nExplained:\nWhen a lead's Person status changes to Approaching in Revenue Grid, along with Salesforce field (Status) changing to \"Attempting to Contact\", also another Salesforce field (Rating) will get populated with corresponding value (Warm).\nAnd since the \"Bidirectional\" checkbox is selected, similarly the mirroring will happen other way around as well. If the field (Rating) of a lead gets changed to (Warm),\nAND\nin the field (Status) gets changed to \"Attempting to Contact\" in Salesforce, then the lead's Person status in Revenue Grid will be changed to \"Approaching\".\nHow to create a new custom Prospect status and map to a Salesforce field (boolean or pick-list types)\nGo to\nSettingsStatus mapping\n8 steps\n1. Choose what type of a status you want to add a new item to (you can add to Success or to Failed statuses, not to General ones)\n2. Click \"New status\" button\n3. Name you new status and click Confirm icon\n4. Click \"New mapping\" button\n5. Choose a Salesforce field (boolean or pick-list types)\n6. Choose a value for that field to be populated once a prospect gets assigned the status\n7. Press \"Save\" button on the bottom of the page\n8. OPTIONAL: If you want the status to get mirrored bidirectionally, then select the corresponding checkbox.\nWhen selected, not only the chosen field will be populated with the chosen value in Salesforce once a prospect is assigned the corresponding Person status, but other way around as well. Meaning, if the chosen value gets populated in Salesforce, then in Revenue Grid the prospect's status will be changed to the corresponding one.\nRefer to this article for description of\nSequence stages\n.\nWas this article helpful?\nYes\nNo\nGet back to us\nWe would love to hear from you!\nName:\nE-mail:\nComment:",

Enforced limits to the number of\nRE Sequence emails\nsent by RG users.\nNumber of sequence email/sms touches an RG user can send per day\nTo prevent SPAM generation, most email services impose a limitation on the number of emails a user (or automated emailing software) can send through a single email account per specific period of time. The applied limit is 1 email sent per 1 minute.\nWhen Revenue Grid sends out emails, both custom written by a user and automated ones, it respects this limitation, observing the one minute minimum interval between sending emails.\nThe recommended (default) value of this setting is 500 emails; this value approximates the maximum number of emails that can be sent over a standard working day's span with a one minute interval. It is the emails quantity \"bandwidth\" shared by all email sequences you run in RG.\nWhen the limit is reached, all remaining automated emails have to be postponed to the following day's sending span defined by the Sequence's Schedule, regardless of the step's actual timeline. Therefore, please consider this standard limit of 500 emails/day per RG user when planning your emailing campaigns.\nThe maximum value that can be set for this parameter is 1000, that is approximately 17 hours of automated emailing per 24 hours. If you do\nnot\nset a limited daily Schedule for the Sequence (for example to imitate emails sending by a real person)  that is emails sending will be allowed for 24 hours, this increased limit is easily attainable, since the automated emails are sent out by your email server.\nImportant\nIn a realistic common case scenario a single RG user can send out around 100 emails per working day; this number is defined by his/her capability to process the recipient's responses to these emails. However, a informative mass email campaign that requires no specific response can make use from the maximum emailing \"bandwidth\".\nPlease note that there is also another factor that defines individual emails dispatching patterns, the *Schedule idle* parameter\nset for Sequence steps\nNumber of sequence call, misc and signal steps scheduled per day\nSet the limit to number of automatic or manual steps of these types that can be scheduled per user per day.\nSequence touches limit per email domain per day\nSet the limit of touches per specific domain to avoid overwhelming a certain company with your outreaches.\nSequence touches limit per prospect per day\nThe number of RG sequence emails allowed to be sent to a prospect per 24 hours. This parameter is set depending on the essence of the campaign and the target auditory. Normally the maximum number of such emails should not exceed 5, not to get a prospect annoyed. Note that this number does not include extra custom emails message composed by a RG user, for example a reaction to a prospects reply or a follow-up clarifying a previously sent email. This parameters default value is 5 and the maximum value is 10.\nSequence touches limit per prospect per week\nThis parameter is similar to the above one, only it sets the RG sequence emails limit imposed over a period of one week. This parameters default value is 10 and the maximum value is 20.\nActive sequences per prospect\nHow many active sequences a user can have at the same time.",

It enlists the available configurable Revenue signals, their descriptions, parameters, and templates.\nRevenue Signals are manually or automatically created alerts for sales representatives that notify about important occurrences and overall deal progress. They ensure that no event, email, or status change remains unnoticed or unreplied.\nWhen a deal reaches a specific stage or a critical occurrence takes place (a new email received, a meeting invite is unresponded for a particular number of days, etc.), signals notify the accountable employees about that and suggest the next steps to take.\nBesides the signals enabled by default and manually created signals, Revenue Grid Intelligence package includes a flexible Signal Builder for creating custom signals of specific types. Below, you can find the detailed overview of the available signals presets, their configurable parameters, and sample templates. The enlisted signals presets are available by default.\nTip\nRefer to\nthis article\nfor an overview of Revenue signals for end users and to\nthis RGES article\nto learn how to manage signals directly from your email client\n1.

Enforced limits to the number of\nRE Sequence emails\nsent by RG users.\nNumber of sequence email/sms touches an RG user can send per day\nTo prevent SPAM generation, most email services impose a limitation on the number of emails a user (or automated emailing software) can send through a single email account per specific period of time. The applied limit is 1 email sent per 1 minute.\nWhen Revenue Grid sends out emails, both custom written by a user and automated ones, it respects this limitation, observing the one minute minimum interval between sending emails.\nThe recommended (default) value of this setting is 500 emails; this value approximates the maximum number of emails that can be sent over a standard working day's span with a one minute interval. It is the emails quantity \"bandwidth\" shared by all email sequences you run in RG.\nWhen the limit is reached, all remaining automated emails have to be postponed to the following day's sending span defined by the Sequence's Schedule, regardless of the step's actual timeline. Therefore, please consider this standard limit of 500 emails/day per RG user when planning your emailing campaigns.\nThe maximum value that can be set for this parameter is 1000, that is approximately 17 hours of automated emailing per 24 hours. If you do\nnot\nset a limited daily Schedule for the Sequence (for example to imitate emails sending by a real person)  that is emails sending will be allowed for 24 hours, this increased limit is easily attainable, since the automated emails are sent out by your email server.\nImportant\nIn a realistic common case scenario a single RG user can send out around 100 emails per working day; this number is defined by his/her capability to process the recipient's responses to these emails. However, a informative mass email campaign that requires no specific response can make use from the maximum emailing \"bandwidth\".\nPlease note that there is also another factor that defines individual emails dispatching patterns, the *Schedule idle* parameter\nset for Sequence steps\nNumber of sequence call, misc and signal steps scheduled per day\nSet the limit to number of automatic or manual steps of these types that can be scheduled per user per day.\nSequence touches limit per email domain per day\nSet the limit of touches per specific domain to avoid overwhelming a certain company with your outreaches.\nSequence touches limit per prospect per day\nThe number of RG sequence emails allowed to be sent to a prospect per 24 hours. This parameter is set depending on the essence of the campaign and the target auditory. Normally the maximum number of such emails should not exceed 5, not to get a prospect annoyed. Note that this number does not include extra custom emails message composed by a RG user, for example a reaction to a prospects reply or a follow-up clarifying a previously sent email. This parameters default value is 5 and the maximum value is 10.\nSequence touches limit per prospect per week\nThis parameter is similar to the above one, only it sets the RG sequence emails limit imposed over a period of one week. This parameters default value is 10 and the maximum value is 20.\nActive sequences per prospect\nHow many active sequences a user can have at the same time.",

This field is not the standard Salesforce field. Thus, if you need this field to be displayed in the Prospects detailed view, submit a corresponding request to the RG Support team.\nEmail Sidebar\nCreate a calendar item with a MS Teams meeting link right from Salesforce\nPer the specific customer's requirement, improved the flow of down-syncing the calendar items created in Salesforce with the selected custom \"Create online MS Teams meeting\" checkbox. Now, when such calendar items are saved from Salesforce to MS Outlook calendar, a corresponding calendar item will be created in the user's mail server calendar with an automatically generated link to an MS Teams meeting.\nAdded one more scenario for saving emails subject to blocklist exceptions\nFine-tuned the email saving via the Add-In: ensured proper email saving if there is at least one non-blocklisted address/domain in a sent/received email, no email address of the sender/recipient is saved to Salesforce as a Lead or Contact, or cannot be associated with any Business record in Salesforce. Learn more about\nstrategies used on not for syncing blocklist applied on saved emails linking\n.\nExpanded the list of Salesforce Partner Communities that can work with RG products\nPer the potential customer's request, we expanded the list of supported Salesforce Partner Community domains to facilitate login with this service and ensure the seamless integration with RG products. Due to specific security limitation, companies that would like to work with Revenue Grid products through Salesforce Partner Community domains, they must send a corresponding request to\nRG Support Team\n.
